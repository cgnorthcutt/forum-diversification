Slaves,,,"I have always had a difficult time with issues revolving slavery.  As the article discussed, since slaves were property, their status meant that they were sexually available to the partner.  I find the idea of someone forcing them self on another morally repugnant!  Yet, in the Ancient world, it appears slaves had few to no rights at all.  I was also surprised that even in marriage, some Christians associate desire with sin.  This seems to lead to a conclusion that marriage partners would need to remain celibate except for issues to procreate."
Women,Slaves,,"I found a couple of surprises... I thought that Roman women (at least among the elite) had rights similar to their spouses. They could own and inherit property for instance. Semitic women, including the Jews, had few rights. I always thought that the introduction of Christianity to the Romans carried an element of putting women in their place, which was inherently inferiority. I've been questioning where this opinion comes from - I think it's a combination of high school Latin class and HBO's Rome! The other challenge was thinking about the difficult position for slaves. Of course their positions were already difficult, but now also a faith challenge!"
Slaves,Women,,"Sadly, none of what we read was new or a surprise to me.  I was fully aware of how women and slaves were treated and that at the behest of their ""master"" or ""husband"" would need to comply with all / any requests.  And this module is about Christianity.....but I do want to point out in history - they aren't the only ones with alpha/male-dominated households.  "
Sex,Slaves,,What surprised me most about ancient ideas of marriage was that the sexual aspect of marriage did not seem to be an important part of marriage. Sex was normally only for reproduction in order for the children to inherit the father's possessions. Sex did not seem to have any intimate meaning between husband and wife as it was even acceptable for husbands to have sex with their slaves since they were considered property. So much of this seems very wrong compared to our morals and virtues today. 
No topic,,,"I was aware of these issues and challenges from past readings of scripture, so I was not surprised.  I have understood that these were compelling issues for the early Christians, and needed to be clarified. "
Sex,Women,Slaves,"Wow!  I had no idea about this particular way that the ancient peoples thought about sex as penetrating vs being penetrated.  It seems more about power and class versus love.  I could understand the status as women and children as property as well as slaves and their children as property.  I think that this belief may take it to a new level of domination over ""lesser"" beings.  For me, this is very troubling.  But this belief may be an indication of how difficult life really was back then."
Women,Status,Slaves,"The fact that the ruling class were the ones making the rules came as no surprise. Those that were well educated, wealthy and having the power that wealth brings making the rules. These rules that were being applied in the early churches were derived from men's (males) interpretation of the  ""Law"". The early church did not have the teachings available to them  that we do. I can understand the upheaval that these new teachings brought. This man Jesus respected women he walked with them and talked to them. Women must have felt a certain amount of empowerment. Sadly it was only a matter of time before  men began to reign them in using Paul's teachings to again enslave them. I was struck by how little things have changed. We in the West believe we live in an enlightened society, but do we?  We still have sex slaves  (both sexes) child abuse, forced marriages, slavery. It is only recently that churches in the West have allowed the integration  of women into the hierarchy of the Church. Sadly this is not duplicated  in all denominations. How little we have learned."
Slaves,,,When did the idea of slaves choosing Christian beliefs become possible?  Since they were property of their masters when did such agency become available?
Sex,Slaves,Marriage,"It might appear that sex outside of marriage was not discouraged among the ancient Israelites. King Solomon (r 970 to 931 BCE) had 300 concubines. Slaves were sexually available to their owners (who had to be males, most were elite males) and children resulting from such relationships were the property of the slave owners.Those who argue that a biblically-approved marriage is between Éone man and one woman should carefully read the Hebrew scriptures, especially the the books of I & II Chronicles and I & II Kings — e.g.  King Solomon had 700 wives. A man can have as many wives as he wishes, so long as he takes care of each wife equally [Exodus 21: 10 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish the food, clothing, or marital rights of the first wife.]The positions stated in the Hebrew scriptures appear to have been changed by the Christian canon. Sex outside of marriage was forbidden. Marriage was between one man and one woman.The Apostle St. Paul made a number of comments opposing Éimmorality, which we assume refers to sex outside of marriage. Paul was opposed to marriage for his followers, as it might interfere with their service to Jesus Christ. However, he did not totally forbid marriage, but said it was better for the Christian man to devote his life to Jesus Christ, without his efforts being divided by a wife. In any case, Paul taught his followers that the Second Cd Coming of Jesus would occur in their lifetime, so there was no need for propagation."
Marriage,Slaves,,"I think what surprised me was that I feel that some of these conceptions are still among some people today. Probably not just among Christian people but in other culture with different religions as well such as dowry tradition, a marriage of convenience, women with sexuality seen as abnormal or sinful, etc. The culture (patriarchal) at the time as well as the scripture and the interpretations of it through people who lived in that culture seems to have a lot of influences on these conceptions, I suppose. I feel these conceptions are more based on male perspectives. I am looking forward to learn more of women/slave point of views."
Status,,,"It seems that sex always poses a dilemma for society.  That, coupled with the new understanding of virtue, posed a real problem for the early church.  They were still struggling to understand Jesus' teachings  **AND** trying to capture the moment and build a church (walking and chewing gum, if you will) that they were sorely confused.  And, then, there was the status element - it really didn't matter what the elite males did.  The problem was the others - the women and slaves.  I see God as having a wonderful sense of humor and this as an excellent example.  "
Status,,,"Striking me head on was this observation: ""It is also the case that most of our evidence comes from elites, so it is less well known what the lives of non-elite persons were like."" So, even though Jesus teaching (as recorded later) centered around humility and concern for those who are downtrodden, the rules that governed the church as it developed were those determined by the elites. It is very easy to lose sight of this truth. While I've tried to maintain a broad view of the historical context of religious teaching, I've mostly failed to keep this factor uppermost in my thinking."
Women,Slaves,,"Most of the information did not surprise me. Women and Slaves have always been known to have no rights when it came to their property and bodies. Even in the fact that their bodies where property. It is a terrible thing that we can look back on this and think that it is so infuriating and silly that another person could be treated this way, but such was the way of life back then. It did not help the fact that people would use such an influential piece of literature : the bible to justify why this happened to certain types of people."
Desire,,,"Associating desire with sin is something irrational. sex is a basic instinct like the need for food and water. God in his scriptures just organize sexual activities bit never said to abstain from it or it is sinful to have a sexual desire. also i found the salves were treated like property is something very ugly."
Status,,,"I was most surprised by the hierarchical assumptions embedded in sexual expression in the First Century.  I'm left puzzling over what the Gospels mean by love, and how that would have played out.  I'm less concerned, somehow, about domestic relations -- except for the feelings of the myriad invisible partners in a slaveholding household.  I'm waiting for the other shoes (how many?) to drop."
Status,,,So glad that you pointed out that most of our evidence of mores and practice come from the elite.  It is so easy to assume that 'everyone' did it- or at least that there were only two social ranks - slave owner and slaves.    The difference in audiences of the various books of the NT point out some of these complications.  
Status,,,I found the idea that what we know of past practices of marriage and sex are based on the elites because it was recorded. The everyday practices of non-elites of early Christians lack evidence of the daily practices. i am intrigued...where there differences? I am using my current historical context to form opinions which is not a good thing!.
Sin,,,"I did find it interesting that early Christians associated passion in sexual relations as being sinful. They were focusing on trying to sublimate a natural aspect of the human condition. Some early Christian leaders may have missed the message of Jesus, that of forgiveness and love. The concept of sin is sometimes used even today as a method of control and to produce feelings of guilt and worthlessness. "
Slaves,,,"The most surprising thing was the role of slaves. I don't recall that much was said in the New Testament about the sexual treatment of slaves, so I never gave the vulnerability of these early Christians much consideration. There are several examples in the Old Testament of slave owners having sex with their slaves. The most compelling example (in my view) was Hagar. She was intentionally impregnated by Abraham, and then she was exiled to fend for herself in the dessert (Genesis 16 & 21). God actually instructed Abraham to mistreat Hagar in this way, according to his wife's request. This is a truly bizarre account.  "
Slaves,,,"None of this information was shocking to me.  However, I have always been appalled at how slaves were treated."
Sex,Marriage,Slaves,"I knew there was some discussion of not marrying in Paul's letters but I was not aware of how complicated the issue was. I was surprised by the idea of a marriage without sexual relations. Also, the idea of sex and status in terms of the male (phallic) was something I had not thought about in quite this way. I was well aware of the slave issue, having studied American slavery to some degree. It does strike me as odd that someone would have sex with something they considered property. Would you have sex with your table for example? So, I think, whether they admitted it or not, having sex with a slave was a de facto recognition of his or her humanity, and therefore rape."
Sex,,,I think the concept of active and passive partners was quite interesting.  Although upon reflection not necessarily shocking considering for how many generations women were considered passive receivers.  Sexual ethics is always a very interesting topic to read and discuss from a religious point of view.
Sex,,,"I was most surprised by the conception of ""active"" and ""passive"" partners, though why I was surprised, I'm not sure. Power issues have been forever at play.  "
Marriage,Slaves,Dowry,"First,  I was surprised to realize that marriage in those times was a contract between the father of the bride and the husband; the bride had no say or power in  this transaction. I am aware that this practice still continued in Europe for some time, and that there are cultures were marriage is an agreement between the parents of the bride and groom. It is amazing to me to realize that there have been all this ways to marry, so different from what one expects today in most societies, that is, that man and woman make the decision to marry.Second, I was amazed to know that masters/mistresses had sexual rights on their slaves, and power to allow them to have a family, or to make them prostitutes. I suppose that I should not be that surprised but it really hit me to see this in the writings."
Marriage,Dowry,,It did surprise me to see mates were chosen for economic reasons. I think today most people choose by attraction and chemistry. I have heard of slavery and how those on a mission for Christ chose celibacy.    
Family,Marriage,,"One of the marriages that surprises me that the man should marry the widow of his brother after his brothers death and after his marriage the child of this new marriage is given the name of the deseased husbandwhich is was lot his real father, what surprises me also that preserving the geneology of the people is one of religious necessities which preserved by Gods law i mean if some one given the name of some one not his father this is a misguidance and unjust this child will inherit wealth of some one not his father  and will share the real sons the inheritance of their real father and many other negative consiequences will be commited"
Sex,,,"It is interesting how the culture in which early Christians lived saw sexuality as a matter of the active vs the passive partners overlaid with this being viewed through the political, social, economic and ethnic status of the people involved."
Sex,Marriage,,"I did not see any new information. Marriage today can be based on attraction and sex appeal a little too much and so it fails. I believe if the partnership is based on common welfare and well being it lasts longer. In todays age people are attracted to the money but beyond that you must have a desire to share all your belongings and show mutual trust and respect or it doesn't last. Both husband and wife must want to be together for many reasons such as religious beliefs, social status and financial stability are the basics and then there is the chemistry and friendship. "
Family,Dowry,,"Although the Apostle Paul was in favor of chastity and marriage contrary, the Jews were to marry for duty and theirs marriages were agreed between families. He, the Apostle Paul, was accused many time of ""single"".Then there is the roman view of the family, where the only one who had power was the ""paterfamilia"" and all other ""things"" were owned and available at will of him"
Sex,,,"I react to the following statement:""Finally, for some ancient philosophers, sexual desire could be seen as morally problematic.  Any properly virtuous action was based on reasoned and proper judgment, which was itself based on the foundation of sure knowledge of the truth.  Virtue was a matter of the will, not of ignorant passion.  This perspective did not reject emotions as such, but only incorrect judgments which prompted immoral activity.  (...) some Christians associated desire with sin, and argued that Christians should act only from will...""My reaction is twofold:1- though with less impact than it had in the past century, that way of thinking is still present today. The sexual revolution (in the West, at least) is partly due to the work of Wilhelm Reich in the 30's and 40's and then to the advent of widespread contraception.2- The text refers to ""philosophers"". I wonder if these philosophers are mainly the product of Greek culture. I don't recall encountering these ideas in the Old Testament which is largely the product of Hebrew culture."
Status,,,"I was not surprised by the reading. I was aware of these issues and the challenges the ancient elites and slaves faced thanks to other history books and even sometimes works of fiction tackle these same topics. I see how my view changed since i was a child where all my ideas came from movies! Thank heavens I read now. "
Sex,,,"I have heard about this discussions a lot and it really bothers me the fact the one can believe God created sex for procriation purposes only. So if a couple is not able to have children, for example, their sexual relationship is a sin? That's really awful. I also don't think that celibate is the right answer according to the Scriptures. Jesus said ""For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others--and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."" Living like ""eunuchs"" for the sake of the kindom of heaven doesn't mean sex is sinful, but that one can chose to live single so they can concentrate 100% of their time to the kindom of heaven, like as a missionary, Paul said something like that as well. And about some of Paul's teaching about marriage, cellibate and even slavery when he says ""Each person should remain in the situation they were in when God called them""  1 Corinthians 7:20; he doesn't mean by saying that that being married or having sex is a bad thing, but the primitive church believed that Jesus would come back at any time, so they should be totally focused on the church and not being worried about getting married, getting free of slavery, because Jesus was coming back and that was all that mattered."
Status,Sex,,"What surprised me most was the relation between higher and lower classes into ta sexual relationship. This was linked (to my surprise) with the concept of ""penetrating"" or ""being penetrating"". And the sex was considered ""natural"" when the higher partner was the active partner. Should this protocol was observed, than the relation was fine! "
Status,Sex,,"I did not know that sexual activity was conceived as a matter of active and passive partners, of penetrating or being penetrated, and thus perpetuating hierarchies of inequality. Key to this was the perpetuation of elite male status, and a ÛÏmeasure for normalcy or acceptability for sexual activity was determined: it is ÛÏnatural when these hierarchies were reproduced (and ÛÏunnatural when they werenÛªt), not just whether or not reproduction was possible.  I also find it interesting that views on marriage and sexual practice varied widely before the ÛÏnorm of monogamous marriage for the purpose of reproduction was established. "
Slaves,,,"I hadn't thought of the fact that slaves were at the will of their masters, and that they did not have the choices when it came to reproduction and parenthood. It interests me to learn what these slave masters thought of their slaves morality and whether or not they need to follow Christian guidelines as well, or if they were considered just property and were not bothered with. "
Children,,,"i was surprised that early Christians struggled with whether to marry or have children at all. i guess i've heard the ""be fruitful and multiply"" thing so often, it felt like it would be the standard for most of Christian history."
Status,Marriage,,"""So when ancient believers were discussing marriage and sexual practices with an eye to understanding what the Christian life ought to entail, their views were freighted with concerns about economics, ethnicity, social order, rational virtue, the proper interpretation of scripture, and GodÛªs will.""My question is: If love between the two individuals is not presumed in marriage, what is the value of love between them with all these other concerns imposed on them?"
Sex,Marriage,,"The definition of sexual activity was surprising although the active and passive partner still seems to be strong today. I was not surprised about the view that slaves were sexual property having been exposed to Greek and Roman history. And the final solution of monogamous marriage and virginal celibacy is found in all the medieval and Renaissance literature  "
Sex,Marriage,,"I think ""sexuality and marriage"" theme is influenced by social and cultural contexts. The old testament shows what happens among jews from time to time and God's responding differently to different contexts and social structure of the Jews communities. This means that God's revelation is contextual through His prophets' speeches. Jesus and Paul also spoke differently to different social contexts in in particular Paul says to different type of communities and God used Paul to give direction to people in different contexts. This shows how wise and how clever our God.  "
Slaves,Sex,Marriage,"I found it fascinating that slaves were treated as property and the master/mastress can help himself or herself to the slave by having sexual relations. The children of slaves were considered property of the master. There were no human right when you were a slave it is challenging to think it that way. In our modern times this will not be acceptable. The other thing was that someone would choose to be a virgin for life, living a life of celibacy. Sex was mainly considered for child bearing and inheritance purposes. They paid bride price and the wife would have no right instead treated as property."
Status,,,"What surprised me was the so called scale of masculinity whereby only elite males are on the top rank of the scale. It sounded to me like the alpha males of a primate group. But this time, the basis is on social status and wealth. "
Slaves,,,"I also felt affected by the text re: slavery in the reading. I am uncomfortable enough with slavery, and never considered much that the slaves were also used for sex, but of course this was the case."
Slaves,Sex,,"When we read about India and how marriage is arranged by parents, one tends to forget that this use was also common in western countries. Furthermore, it remained essential to monarchy throughout centuries. Kings and nobleman, in turns, also had absolute privileges over their subjects, to the extent of sexual behavior. Concepts like ""Prima nocte "" or  ""Fornication Under Consent of the King ""  are sad reminder of such.But slavery is far worse, having no rights meant exactly that. No justice, no ownership of ones body, this abomination is impossible to conceive. Sadly,  all this was supported with incorrectly interpreted scripture."
Sex,,,"It does not surprise me at all when I consider that the behavior of those people started from the basic of the human understanding of life. With time passing by the human evolved and sexual behavior stand on different ground. The men started understanding the sexual relationship with women and what it bring with it. The responsibilities assumed by men and women on the long run when children were involved in a marriage started changing the sexual and marriage behavior of both men a women. Although it still has the different rolls in society as the dominant and the dominated almost always the men and the women.At the beginning the Christians believe that having sexual intercourse the sin appears and that seem to be the reason for seen the sex as sin when done outside marriage. Sex always brings disagreement, discussion, separation, quarrelsome, and so on and so forth when the partner (he and she) are immature. I can imagine the situations in those days when people where so little evolved in all the phases of life.   "
Slaves,,,"I was not surprised by the introduction as many years ago I studied roman history as part of a degree. Probably in the C1st AD the majority of the population of the Roman Empire were slave, freed, or non-citizens. Then add the free female population. Paul was unusual, being a citizen."
Slaves,Dowry,,"There was no surprise here.  In fact, all motivations, including expression of powers, remain in play until this day.  The big difference is that there would not be a formal arrangement stating that this is the case.  Slavery is gone from most of the world, but there are people who are not able to just say no.  In addition, there remain a good number of marriages where the finances are a significant part of the arrangement.Fortunately, a lot of change has taken place, and it is certainly more the situation that marriages are actual partnerships.  Also, for the population at large, the idea of engaging in a relationship sanctioned by God still exists.  To end all forms of coercion in marital and sexual relationship it will be necessary to even out the financial distribution."
Gender,,,In ancient marriage system women played passive role. It is not at all surprising in the male-dominated society. Their main role in the family was to produce children and to maintain the lineage of the family.  
Sex,Women,Slaves,"As was pointed out in the reading, sexuality haunts Christian thought and always has.  I believe from what we have encountered in the study so far we see the Christian practice modifying and fluxing based upon the culture where it finds itself.  The imbalance of power between persons is not something I think of readily given my life in the US where laws are expected to protect equally (I say that with an understanding reality and expectation are often different) but I know from historical study it carried huge weight.  It is disturbing that human property extended all the way to providing service for a master's sexual appetite.The struggle over sexuality is still real. If you take the struggles the Christian Church is facing with contemporary sexual practices and identity you see it born out.  The church had never come to terms with heteronormitive sexuality much less issues such as homosexuality or gender identity issues.  Even concepts such as marriage which many hold as ""traditional"" are relatively new culturally.  Most people are unaware that ~70% of all marriages worldwide are still arranged marriages and what we practice the the US and western Europe is not the norm.  It leads you to question what were the priorities in the early Church that enabled it grow so rapidly amid persecution and oppression in a world filled with slavery and social imbalance.  I believe it was the mandate to love and care for one another as your family.  This was relatively new in religious thought.  I also believe it was the equality found within the Christian practice:  Niether male or female, Jew or Greek, Free or Slave was a radical thought.  Yet within all that the struggle continued."
Marriage,,,"For early Chistians, marriage was a ""second choice"", whereas for early Muslims it was the ""first choice"", in terms of compliance with the will of God. This has historical consequences  persisting up to the present days."
Marriage,,,Even the Most cursory reading of St Paul on the topic of Marriage would have advised one that the whole question of Marriage was under review. The problem was a faith which preached the equality of all sinners and the social norms of the time. 
Status,Sex,Marriage,"Did anything surprise or challenge you about ancient conceptions of marriage and sexuality? Life must have been indeed incredibly hard for slaves and women in the context covered by this exercise. The idea of being someone's property in order to promote and retain wealth, in the case of women, or being someone's sex toy goes against all the principles we know and live by now. "
Sex,Marriage,,"The conceptions of marriage, sexuality, and celibacy described in this reading are consistent with what I would have expected, particularly regarding the discussion of the hierarchical aspects and in the efforts to harmonize the conflicts between marriage and celibacy."
Sex,Sin,,"As Christ said ""But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" (Matthew 5:28). Through many of the bible teachings, we can find that the idea of true christian marriage- and therefore sex- can be understood. Paul gave some instructions to those who were married to non-believers, but the main idea was already settled by Jesus. "
Slaves,Women,Dowry,"There are two remarkable things for me: first, sexuality norms, was not strictly respected with all social class. For example, Abraham, (the father of faith) had a boy with his slave. King David, send to war (and to for kill) to his first commandant because he desired his woman. Both have their own womens, nevertheless, they preferred another.Virginity, was a priority in Israel, whence they went to Egypt to Canaan land, youth young man must to have to pay a dowry,  if they incurrs in sexual act before marriage,  moreover, the must to have marriage with such girl.  I also remember the history of ten virgins, is a reflect of cultural situation in jesus time"
Sex,Women,,"There was nothing surprising. Everything was as expected. But now we know there's nothing called sin. There are actions that go against the social evolution of human race and there are actions that facilitate human progress. One may label the actions detrimental to our social progress as sin but I do not see any different or better definition of sin beyond that. That means I refuse to let any ancient book define sin for me. So adultery is no more sinful if having sex becomes a normal and socially acceptable way of people greeting each other just like a handshake.<br><br> Birth of child is associated with sexual intercourse as well as the original sin, so that could be the reason people were confused if sex was sinful or not sinful. Consensual sex between adults is in no way harmful to society in any manner, even between people who are married to a different person (if we live in a society where it is normal to allow one's spouse to have multiple sexual affairs with minor consultation the way one consults one's spouse before making financial investments), so such kind of sex can never ever be labeled sinful.<br><br> It is that easy but unless there is a fundamental shift in our thinking that breaks free of the chains of conventional thought process, there's a long way for us to learn and go."
Sex,Marriage,,"I wouldn't say that anything was necessarily a surprise to me, however, I was interested to find out that sexuality was considered a moral issue even within the context of marriage and having relations with your partner. While I understand the fear they may have had, it would have never occurred to me that people were concerned with sex in the same way after marriage. It was no surprise to hear that the rich white men were on the top if the sexual food chain so-to-speak. I think in some ways, this kind of thinking is still very much alive in our American culture and around the world. I did not realize, however, that at one time, many Christians agreed that virginal celibacy was preferred over having sexual relations within the context of marriage, even for reproductive purposes. "
Status,,,"I found it interesting that there was a ""conceptualization of social hierarchies""  associated with sexual activity in antiquity. This seems like the genesis of dominant attitudes that any one who was different from the ruling and majority class of males would be identified as ""passive"" and would end up on the bottom. How ironic. Of course, all the factors of ethnicity, slave, free, male female, etc. played a critical role  in constructing this institution of dominance. I refer to it as an institution because we are still dealing with these ""good old boys"" attitudes in the 21st century when it comes to sex. The dominant elitism that emerged in antiquity has served as the foundation for the proliferation of making a non-elite person a victim. Ironically, this ""institutional dominance"" has extended itself into our social, political, and economic fabric of society. what an indictment on social justice that this phenomena began over 2,000 years ago. "
Social Progress,,,"While admittedly these customs are alien to some of us in the West in the 21st century, it seems to me that a number of people posting are forgetting that these customs were perfectly normal *at the time.* Think of the alternatives - pantheism, polygamy, barbarianism. When one does, it really puts it into perspective. Fortunately - although I agree with many of the posters that too much has not changed - much has."
Marriage,,,"What would the early Christians say if they lived today?  Marriage of ancient  times appears to have  been driven by economic need, social context and  the emerging consciousness  of the "" reluctant"" Christian voice. ( Jesus was a Rabbi from the Hebrew Tradition,  after all). It seems that the  emergence  of Christianity influenced the many  ritusl practices of birth, marriage and death, deeply changing these experiences as a new social context of merging cultures between Jews and gentiles appeared to form new communities.  The practice of appproaching marriage as an agreement between  the bride's father and the groom , is still true today, although  not necessarily  in a Christian  context. Being a woman, or a slave  provides no protection,  not even within those new times.  Within this context Christ's call to celebrate what is to become one of the sacrements struggles for identity even today.I found the meanjng making of this ""alliance between  the two"" to be profoundly fascinating.   Its early challenges seem to remain alive even today."
Status,Women,Slaves,"I was aware of these issues. Women and slaves had no rights. They were properties of their owner. Slaves were also sexually available to their owner. The most surprising is that, unfortunately,  some of these aspects do still exist among some people today. "
Sex,,,"God created men as endowed with eternal life. When life is eternal, the procreation of new life through sex or whatever way is not only unnecessary, but undesired. Because on a closed system as the Earth is, procreating children when nobody dies could cause severe problems very soon. Still Adam and Eve, even before the Fall, enjoyed sex. That's because the Lord wants us to enjoy. Not only His creation, but life and each other as well. Sex by the way is very helpful in promoting health. People who enjoy sex on a daily basis, as everyone should do, live longer and are in general healthier than people who don't have sex very often or even not at all. It is very important that you have sex as God has intended you to do. For only then, God will bless you, your spouse and your relation. Man and women who engage in homo-sex on the other hand, are often sick, have all kinds of mental and health problems and live shorter lives than heterosexuals. In general, homosexuals live 20% shorter than heterosexuals and have a lower quality of life as well. Why sex? Sex is not necessary to procreate new life. For their are many non-sexual ways in which life is procreated on this Earth. I think sex is a way for men and women to focus on each other. Because men and women are so different, they need a very strong urge to look for one another. That urge is the strongest men have: sex. Without sex there is no need for men or women to go after one another. Watch for example groups of men and women. It takes a very short time before the group splits into male and female subgroups. Nobody arranges this, it happens spontaneously. Very young children for example seem to hate the other sex, until sexual desire comes into play, Only then they become interested in the other sex. Its not for nothing that Genesis 2 tells us that before the Fall and after the creation of Eve, men did not felt shame for his nakedness, meaning they had sex whenever they wanted and wherever they wanted.  Even in the presence of the Lord. Notice that the first thing happening after the Fall was that men felt ashamed of his nakedness and felt a need to cover his nakedness. Since then our sexuality is burdened. From then sex even became a problem. For when it still should be no problem, we should not have discussed it in this course. "
Slaves,Sex,,"I found the idea of what was considered to be ""natural"" sex very interesting and odd.  I guess there was no chance of equal partnership!  One thing that was very disturbing, however, was the fact that slaves could be used sexually by their owners.  It seems that idea carried over into American slavery.  "
Sex,Marriage,,"I was both surprised and challenged by the ancient conceptions of marriage and sexuality.  The patriarchal hierarchy is astonishing: Marriage was generally an agreement between men, i.e., the father (or other person responsible for the bride) and the groom and ÉMarried women had few legal rights and little or no control over property. This hierarchy was extended to include slaves as property giving their owners free sexual access while not even acknowledging marriage or family connections among slaves.  I understand these views were common among ancient people and not just the Christians we are discussing here.  What I find so disturbing, however, is that these concepts are exactly the commonly held stereotypes now condemned by vast numbers of Christians of modern Muslims.  The second concept which I had no former knowledge of which I found even more disturbing was the view on sexual activity and how this view was crucial to maintaining hierarchies of social inequality: É#sexual activity was conceived in large part as a (phallic) matter of active and passive partners: that is, of penetrating or being penetrated#. the active partner should always be of higher status than the passive partner giving everyone except elite males lower status. It doesnÄt take a big leap ap from these constructs to understanding how the rape of women became a ÛÏrite of men which remains as prevalent in our modern world as any earlier time in history."
Slaves,,,"What I like is reading the response of most of my peers. We read these articles and view them with our modern perspectives of equality and the morality laws we live in. Slavery for example, I don't know how people view slavery in some cases maybe the movie Roots or Amistad might play a big roll on their perspective of slavery. The time of slavery in the Old testament is totally different. There are verses in the OT that gives us hints about their lives. Exodus 21 gives us hints of their rights. Deuteronomy 5:13 ""Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. 15 You shall remember that you were a slave[c] in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm."" This shows us that male and female servents may enjoy the same privilage of leasure as their free masters. Also the Hebrews were reminded to observe the festivals with their male and female slaves, you can read that in Deuteronomy 16:10-12. The Israelities had good food while they were slaves in Egypt, Exodus 16:3 ""If only we had died by the LORD's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted."" Last example that slavery was not like what we think it is, is the story of Joseph who was sold as a slave and became the second most powerful man in Egypt. When I hear people bring up slavery and compare it with how we view slavery today I smile and I give them detailed information and they don't enjoy it. Today society is equality for everyone to a point. "
Status,,,It was interesting to read that sexuality was based on hierarchy. Not a lot of the information was surprising in terms of ambiguity around sexuality.  
No topic,,,I am interested to see how sexuality was and is important for religion and what has religion with sexuality to do?
Slaves,,,"I find more the things that are missing from all of the topic. The idea that slaves were property. Sorry but in ancient Jewish tradition they may or may not be. many times slaves were those brought in to the household to fulfill duties and they were respected. You no more abuse a slave than any other possession. They were far from a is personified in Uncle Tom's Cabin. The role of reproduction falls far from what we consider today. In Jewish belief the woman was only an incubator. The material deposited with her was the whole of life with the total zygote came from the male. We seem to leave out the cultures surrounding the early Christians with only passing mentions while they had very strong influences.  Much of the letters of Paul to the early churches addressed not only Jewish influences but the influences of other ""pagan"" religious rituals as those churches contained mainly people who were former practitioners of those religions. One of Paul's most controversial writings relates to male temple prostitution in Corinth. "
Sin,,,"I found interesting the perspective that sexual desire could be seen as problematic.  I could understand the notion that some Christians associated desire with sin, however, it was interesting to read that desire for even their spouse/marital partner could be viewed as a sin."
Marriage,,,In my opinion sexuality has not diversified it always existed since time began what I feel is marriage and its sacraments have changed over the years in today's society we forget our commitment to God and our relationship
Social Progress,,,I am quiet surprised at how sex was taken so trivially at the time. I am having difficulty understanding how sex was seen as a past time and slaves were sexually used. I think the world has actually changed so much over the years. hope it changes for the better still with time
Sex,,,"Note that sex for many was seen as something sinful if treated with promiscuity and that was only in order to perpetuate the species. However, we see that sex had its highs and lows according to the development of history. By some seen as something romantic and others as mentioned above, connected to original sin.We also see that at some point sex was mainly free the slaves and the offspring resulting from this relationship were only seen as property, no hereditary bond."
Sex,Marriage,,"**A Roman Wedding**--Artist not credited (I suspect Lawrence Alma-Tadema).![][1]**Did anything surprise or challenge you about ancient conceptions of marriage and sexuality?  Choose one or two to discuss.**Yes, I was surprised there was little discussion of romance. I believe the concept of romantic love and marriage is relatively recent but I am more ""wedded"" to it than I thought. I keep looking for it where there is not much reason to suppose it existed. As Professor King writes,*""The first [application of sexuality] is the importance of marriage for establishing the household, a basic structure for social and economic relations.""*This strikes me as an eminently practical approach, especially in view of the uncertainties of life in Old Testament times and even during the time of the Roman Empire.  Death, destruction, illness, violence, crime and war were never far from the marital doorstep and the the social ties created by marriage were likely far more important than the couple's  happiness, let alone their romance. Fortunately, they had wine to take the edge off.On the matter sexuality and how it fits into morality or immorality, Professor King writes:*""Finally, for some ancient philosophers, sexual desire could be seen as morally problematic. åÊAny properly virtuous action was based on reasoned and proper judgment, which was itself based on the foundation of sure knowledge of the truth. åÊVirtue was a matter of the will, not of ignorant passion.So when ancient believers were discussing marriage and sexual practices with an eye to understanding what the Christian life ought to entail, their views were freighted with concerns about economics, ethnicity, social order, rational virtue, the proper interpretation of scripture, and GodÛªs will.*Yes. Well, I appreciate the daunting task ancient believers faced but let me help them out from 2000 years in the future:""[C]oncerns about economics, ethnicity, social order, rational virtue, the proper interpretation of scripture, and GodÛªs will"" probably have changed in the last two millennia but sex hasn't.  Not one bit. It remains ignorant, passionate, sometimes lacking in virtue and it can be socially and economically disadvantageous. People still do it and celibacy remains a hard sell in 2016 the same as it was in the year 0.Rationally speaking,  YOU, ancient elders bet on the wrong horse. Currently, there are many people, especially women, trying to correct your mistakes.![][2]  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1461270632700371.jpg  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14612726687033865.jpg"
Marriage,Dowry,,"Did anything surprise or challenge you about ancient conceptions of marriage and sexuality? Choose one or two to discuss.**The concept of reproduction being tied to inheritance is a challenge for me because there is always the possibility that one is unable to conceive.  In the Bible there were many women who had difficulty conceiving and they were looked down upon by the community.  It was almost the feeling of being shunned for something that was out of their control.  Many passages in the Bible outline the great desire of women praying for a child or their womb to be opened, so they could give their husbands an heir.  It is easy to see conception and reproduction are connected to inheritance and why it was so important to have children.  The agreement between the father of the bride and the groom is challenging to me because the bride has no say so  in the agreement formulated.  My daughter works with a young lady who was recently married in an arranged marriage to a man that's almost 40 years her senior.  Many might not think that this practice is active today, but it is very much still in existence for some cultures.  My daughter states that the young lady is so miserable and cried often at work.  I think that this practice then or now is so difficult to adjust to, but I believe it was for religious and cultural reasons.  As in Judaism, we are taught to marry another Jewish person in order to produce Jewish children, but the marriages are not arranged in the same standards as the discussion outlined.**"
Women,,,It's frustrating to me that Christianity seems to have been established and run by men - men who had control over women AND slaves. I often wonder what the story would have been through the eyes of women and slaves.   Or what would it have looked like if WOMEN were in charge or there was NO slavery?
Sex,Sin,,"I was surprised to find that traditionally sex itself was considered sinful by Christianity whereas it is a normal biological process and if God created man, and his biological cycles like, birth, death, hunger, thirst, defecation and sex. It signifies  man's beautiful emotions like love and is a step to procreation that is new life, so how can it be sinful?"
No topic,,,Is dont equilibre is the married is celebrated is men anf women and sexuslity is knowlefgebis married is the most importsnt of thr christisn.
Marriage,,,"I learned about the subordinate position of women in ancient society. As marriage was typically a financial agreement related to inheritance, I wonder how many marriages were loving experiences for the couple and how many were just tolerated. I learned that households contained several generations, plus the slaves.  I learned that ancient philosophers felt that sex should be based on reason and proper judgment rather than passion.  I learned that monogamous marriages for the purpose of  reproduction was permitted but virginal celibacy was considered a higher path."
Sex,,,"The paragraph that caught my attention was:""Second, sexual activity was conceived in large part as a (phallic) matter of active and passive partners: that is, of penetrating or being penetrated.  Under this conceptuality, what was crucial was that social hierarchies of inequality be reproduced: the active partner should always be of higher status than the passive partner.  Factors in determining status included not only whether one was male and female, but also age, class, slave or free, and ethnicity.  From this perspective everyone except elite males would therefore rank lower on a scale of masculinity.  Sex was considered to be ÛÏnatural when these hierarchies were reproduced (and ÛÏunnatural when they werenÛªt)ÛÓwhether or not reproduction was possible.  Attitudes toward same-sex relations varied, but the arguments assumed the same way of thinking.""TO me this means that the sex act was always interpreted with one person as the dominant, one person with all the power - the elite male being on top, of course. My ideas about marriage and sexuality are so based on my situatedness that it is hard for me to understand or relate to other ways of thinking about marriage and sexuality.  I think that our culture (in the US) is still really struggling with how to deal with differences in sexuality."
Status,Marriage,,"The hierarchical nature of society resulted in an enormous disparity of opportunity for living a natural and self chosen life path. It cannot be justified in equitable terms. Yet, it still exists today as it did in Biblical times. Marriage and slavery reflected property rights and notions of human rights were light years away. This is incongruous with religious values of fairness, equal treatment and love.  "
Status,,,"The two issues did not really surprised me having studies theology for quite a time.  The readings though pointed out that the so-called Biblical view on sex, gender, marriage, and slavery--were products of reflections and theological constructions and reconstructions.  "
Sex,,,"It was interesting to see that the majority of issues surrounding sex really had nothing to do with sex, and much more to do with power and control.  It makes more sense that it would have been a contentious topic when viewed in that way."
Women,,,"These issues do seem confusing, especially given the conflicting scriptural stances on whether or not a person should marry. I know I am situated by being an American woman in the modern era, but it seems so unfair that women could not choose who to marry and were forced to be the ""passive"" person sexually. It is just so outside of the bounds of what I find morally acceptable that I have a hard time even dealing with it on its own terms. "
Slaves,,,"The place of slaves as sexual chattel makes sense in the context presented, but I had never considered it -- what a dehumanizing institution."
Marriage,,,"It's interesting to me since recently I have been looking to see what the biblical interpretation of sex in marriage was. Looking at the way it was interpreted in the past seems dark and obscure especially when you add slaves to the mix. I always felt that through Christianity especially being a Catholic that sex and marriage was something between a man a woman and God, being blessed through the Church. Anything out of that was sin. Also reading that the ultimate goal was to be a virgin was intriguing since the message has always been to procreate as much as you can within your marriage. "
Sex,Marriage,,"This is such a great perspective. I find it very interesting since I had married a non believer who passed from cancer a year into our marriage. I recently got remarried through the catholic church and having to show proof of my previous marriage and death certificate as well as testimony of us being free to marry. On it's own yes there are so many politics, include sex and it changes many things. There is a passage in the bible that states that when you have relations with another person your souls marry. This can be confusing especially when discussing marriage. How, when where? Do you need a ritual or do you marry once you have intercourse?"
Sex,,,"Nothing at all did surprise me. Christianity brought new moral issues: sex outside the marriage, the possibility of a way of life without sex, the monks of our days."
Sex,,,"I thought it was interesting that the issue of celibacy had a basis in pre-Christian philosophy concerning whether passion should ever come into a decision or action, but rather, only logic or rational thought.  It sure made life for everyone who was not a rich white male pretty unpleasant and certainly lacking in control."
Marriage,,,"Marriage like scriptures, has been embedded in culture for centuries.  Christ jesus, nor any of the apostles ever married.  Although the first miracle, turning water to wine, was recorded at a wedding.  But the will of the inner person I would agree allows us to choose the path in life that we would like to follow.  The family, culture, tradition, I would say would influence us to decide whether or not to get married.  "
