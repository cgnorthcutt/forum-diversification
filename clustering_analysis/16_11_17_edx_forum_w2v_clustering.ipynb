    "# # 5705e19d81e07b055c000bc0 - Same scriptures for bibles? - Please offer your reflections on the fact that not all Bibles have the same contents. Do you think it is important that people belonging to the same tradition share the same scriptures? Why or why not? Please post your response and respond to the posts of at least two of your peers.\n",
    "# # 5702af2c10e0fd052100099c - Christianity practiced locally - Post what you found along with brief comments about what it is and why you find it distinctive or typical of Christianity where you live. Read at least five postings of your peers in preparation for answering the next discussion question.\n",
    "# # 570bf4976fcfa50548000266 - Beginnings of the gospels - Now that you’ve read the introductions to the four New Testament gospels and examined their particular similarities, differences, and emphases, consider the following questions: What do readers learn about the content of these gospels and about Jesus by reading their introductions? What expectations might readers have as they begin to read each gospel? How would you now address the issue of why the New Testament has four gospels rather than a single narrative? Please post your reflections on the discussion board and respond to at least two of your peers.\n",
    "# # 5705e53810e0fd052d000c3a - Canons - Often people ask about who chose which books would be included in the Bible and why. We’ve asked you to notice that the content of Bibles are different and changing. The Protestant Luther, for example, removed books from the Catholic canon and created a smaller Protestant canon. Ethiopians have a much larger canon. And now as more early Christian books are discovered in Egypt, some are suggesting these might be added to a “new New Testament.” Please share 1-3 things about the readings on canon and new discoveries that you found especially interesting or surprising. Please post your reflections and respond to the posts of at least two of your peers.\n",
    "# # 570bf5946fcfa5055000026e - Nativity Scene - The nativity scene of Jesus’s birth is widely represented not only in artistic representations, but today also by small models in homes, life-size exhibits at churches, or through live staged enactments—and indeed you may have seen them in your own home, church, or another public space. If we consider these representations as interpretations of the gospel narratives, what do you think they communicate about Jesus? About the beliefs of Christians? What difference do you think it makes whether people read each gospel independently, read and compare all the gospel birth stories, or interpret Jesus’s birth through harmonized nativity scenes? Please post your reflections on the discussion board and respond to at least two of your peers. \n",

These are so central to those of us that live in this culture, that it is really difficult to imagine how these constructs might have evolved differently.  I also find it difficult to envision the future of Christianity, which is likely to incorporate a significant influence from non-Western cultures, and may change in ways that will seem strange to my Western sensibilities.   \n",

I am interested in how countries that are primarily Christian have done bad things to other countries and to their own people.  This is not to drag up old history, or portion out blame, but to better understand how/why it seems to be consistent that \"good people do bad things to other people\".\\n3. I am interested how scripture deals with the question of evil.  I have always had a problem with the idea of how a benevolent God correlates to a world with a great deal of evil.\\n\\nAgain these questions are not to apportion blame or challenge other people's beliefs, they are honest questions of how scripture deals with the world as it is.  I can see how the idea of culture affecting religion, and how it is important to understand stiltuatedness fits into some of these questions.</td>\n",

I cannot agree with such a theology but I can understand why people would be confused. After 40 some years of being a Christian, I have learned there are some things we can intellectually explore so far before we must rely on faith and not on our own understanding.</td>\n",

       "77   Three comments as opposed to what I learned:\\n\\n1. it was at a high level and most of it I had heard at one time or another before.  On the other hand it was a nice summary that showed me just how much there is to learn if the class dives deeper into scripture and the difference between the different religions\\n2.  I am interested in how countries that are primarily Christian have done bad things to other countries and to their own people.  This is not to drag up old history, or portion out blame, but to better understand how/why it seems to be consistent that \"good people do bad things to other people\".\\n3. I am interested how scripture deals with the question of evil.  I have always had a problem with the idea of how a benevolent God correlates to a world with a great deal of evil.\\n\\nAgain these questions are not to apportion blame or challenge other people's beliefs, they are honest questions of how scripture deals with the world as it is.  I can see how the idea of culture affecting religion, and how it is important to understand stiltuatedness fits into some of these questions.   \n",

The art was fascinating and very thought provoking! Reading and in some cases, re-reading passages, allowed me to make a connection and have a better understanding of different protestant practices and where they were born out of. I think my favorite part was reading about the pilgrimages. I have always been fascinated by different sacred places having made the trip to Rome to see the Vatican and hoping to someday visit Jerusalem.    \n",

I cannot agree with such a theology but I can understand why people would be confused. After 40 some years of being a Christian, I have learned there are some things we can intellectually explore so far before we must rely on faith and not on our own understanding.   \n",

This wasn't really new but did reinforce what I have previously learned. I also learned that the first schisms within the church were within the first few hundred years of it's inception if not before. I had previously thought that all Christians were Catholic prior to the Protestant Reformation. Finally, I learned that the diversity of denominations varies regionally, culturally, and even locally. Well, I didn't really learn that but it was reinforced and expanded upon in my own knowledge.   \n",

These are so central to those of us that live in this culture, that it is really difficult to imagine how these constructs might have evolved differently.  I also find it difficult to envision the future of Christianity, which is likely to incorporate a significant influence from non-Western cultures, and may change in ways that will seem strange to my Western sensibilities.   \n",

The Authors of the Bible  make massive use of quote and allusion to make their points and if you don't  know what they are quoting you can miss 90% of the message. As an example most people don't know that the second most quoted book in the New testament after Isaiah is actually 1 Enoch\\n\\nCommon Books keep the discussion on what is meant as opposed to what is authoritative.  Because we use the Book of Mormon  a lot of time  is used up speaking with other Christians on whether it is a legitimate source for doctrine.\\n\\nAs a resource  here is [the online edition of the LDS scriptures][1]\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.lds.org/scriptures?lang=eng</td>\n",

I may sound prejudiced, but the Book of Mormon seems to be outside of the usual circle of Christianity.  Mormons use the Old Testament and New but rely more on the Mormon scriptures. Not unlike the Muslims that have Old and New Testaments in their belief, but rely more on the Qur'an.   \n",
       "10   Question one is How do you define the tradition?  It helps when we are studding together to have a common frame of reference.  The LDS church Uses the King James Bible in English in part so we can more easily see the connections between the Bible and the Book of Mormon which was translated at a time when that was the common Bible and so uses that kind of scriptural language.   The Authors of the Bible  make massive use of quote and allusion to make their points and if you don't  know what they are quoting you can miss 90% of the message. As an example most people don't know that the second most quoted book in the New testament after Isaiah is actually 1 Enoch\\n\\nCommon Books keep the discussion on what is meant as opposed to what is authoritative.  Because we use the Book of Mormon  a lot of time  is used up speaking with other Christians on whether it is a legitimate source for doctrine.\\n\\nAs a resource  here is [the online edition of the LDS scriptures][1]\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.lds.org/scriptures?lang=eng   \n",

It probably helps with uniformity and communication but different writings will\"speak\" to different people and so faith might be influenced by something outside the orthodoxy of your group - the problem, as I see it,  is the attitude we have towards our own bible, usually that it is the only source of God's revelations, and our disregard ( in my case, ignorance) of everyone else's.

For example, where I am from, Evangelical Christians and Roman Catholics see each other as a different religion itself.    \n",

If you view it as a written by God or as the absolute word of God, then you'd probably think that everyone should use one standard version. But if you feel that the 10 commandments were they only \"word of God\" and that the rest is just stories, and moral values of a different time, then you might argue that while you should keep the 10 commandments, perhaps the rest might be in need of an update, or add on as time goes by.    \n",

Because when you allow the Holy Spirit to teach you, in full humilty, you just know they are the ones that matter.

Each religion or denomination is going to form their own interpretations that best suit their needs anyway but I don't find it helpful to hide some of the books from followers.

There will always be disputes between the denominations about what the Scriptures really mean. I know Protestants who don't think Catholics are real Christians because they haven't been \"born again.\" I know Catholics who think Protestants aren't real Christians because their pastors often have no formal training and therefore lack authenticity. I know both Protestants and Catholics who think Joseph Smith was a fraud, and therefore Mormons aren't real Christians. These disputes will likely continue whether the Scriptures are the same or not, because even the Scriptures they share are interpreted differently.    \n",

I can understand why the Mormon’s have additional books because a lot of their belief comes from the Book of Mormon, more modern day happenings than the rest of the Bible. That the Catholic and Orthodox books are different isn’t surprising since some of their theology is different. Still it seems all of the Protestant Bibles should contain the same books. Since most of the books in the Bible are “closed”, I would think they would all become uniform over time. It seems that would make the entire Christian world be more consistent and help the various sects communicate better with each other.   \n",

I did not know that there were so much other bibles in circulation. I am used to reading the christian bible. (holy bible).  That is all I know.  So much other bibles ....  \\n\\nI think if we belong to the same tradition we should share the same scriptures.  If we share the same scriptures we may get the same interpretation and be in agreement with each other.  The question is which  bible should we use as a standard ?  Christian scriptures or the others?   \n",

Who decides that Ezra 1 or Tabitha should or should not be in my bible?  To me faith is a personal matter and I don't want anyone telling me what I have to believe or the books I should read. It's all about diversity and situatedness  A person's belief system is based on his/her family, time in history, language, education, so many things.  So NO I don't think there should be one set of Scriptures, any more than there should be only one True Faith.\\n   \n",

There have also been various translations of the Bible from the Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic.  Comparing the differences gives me a sense of what the people of the times might have experienced as they chose what books to include.

As a roman Catholic, I hear the added books in our readings and yet they are treated with less emphasis as far as I can tell.  The more information that I read and the more possibilities to understand seems like a good thing to grow in understanding.  Those who don't want to know more will be content with the affirmations of their denomination.   I really would like to read the Dead Sea scrolls!   \n",

For the few few hundred years of the church the books of what we call the New Testament had not yet been gathered. They went by whatever book(s) they had. And today, Christians know and love some books and rarely read others. Most haven't spent much time in Ezekiel or Lamentations but they may, for example, love the Book of John and the Book of Romans. Each Christian, in my opinion, forms their own canon by the books they choose to read and know and the books they leave behind (in some sense).

The Apocryphal books were not considered inspired by the Protestants but seen as good for reading. The books were placed between the OT and the NT to signify that it was not considered as part of the Canon. The current differences should make it obvious that the same Scriptures should be shared by all claiming the same tradition. One of the points of division, for example, is the prayers for the dead which is found in the 2 Maccabees. If it is true then it contradicts what Jesus taught. It says: Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from this sin. This is contrary to the Gospel found in the Bible in the NT and early Christian traditions. It also contradicts the law of the OT. A house divided cannot stand; likewise a tradition using different Scriptures within itself will never be a unified tradition.     \n",

Early bibles were chained to the pulpits! Unfortunately one main book of worship will not be a reality due to man having few will and choice about what he allows into his life.

IMHO most people get by with a few verses and a distillation of the Christian message as proffered by their fellow believers, preachers, and theologians. The vast majority of Christians probably don't even know the extent that Bibles differ. Let's keep it quiet- one less thing to argue about ;)   \n",

The differences often grew out of a difference in history.  The Ethiopian bible, for instance, grew out of the circumstance that they are one of the oldest Christian communities and were quite isolated from other branches of the tradition for a long time.  It would seem unreasonable to ask them to give up  portions of their scripture in order to be in synch with most other Christians who differ greatly among themselves.\\nThe Bible has never seemed to me to be one thing.  It is a collection of books.  Some of those books are reproduced in versions meant for children, others are turned into Sunday morning cartoon versions.  The various books have been translated in various ways by people with particular agendas.  The Good News bible, for example, is meant for people who may struggle with some of the standard vocabulary,.\\nI live in a part of the world that seems to \"worship\" the King James version of the bible, which seems quite unreasonable as his translators did not have the skills in Greek and Aramaic that have led scholars to some of their interesting revisions.\\nI for one would consider the Bible to be a work in progress, that has variations that have meaning to various groups at various times.</td>\n",

In the introductory video scripture is defined as literature with unique authority; I think if two groups believe that they share the same faith but disagree on the source of divine authority there are obviously going to be conflicts. One of the reasons I phrased my answer in that way is that many individuals and denominations that consider themselves christians do not consider other denominations that do not share their bible christian. To me, the question kind of begs the question of wether the different faith traditions we are studying are the same religion at all, based purely on some degree of shared scripture. My question here is similar to one I was trying to answer in my original post; at what point does scripture become so different it is no longer christian at all? \\n\\nIn the concrete case of christianity, I think we need to look at the history behind the differentiation of the bible, as other comments have suggested. My understanding is that the bible was originally a set of books that circulated individually among early christian communities. I think that your decision about what books to use is a decision about how legitimate the editing process that brought us those books was. You could decide that all revelation circulated as a book of the bible in the years after jesus' death was divine, and see the dead sea scrolls as legitimate in the same way the letters of Paul are. Or you could decide that the church authorities who created the holy bible were divinely inspired, as you could with any other codification of the books of the bible. With mormonism this faith in divine inspiration of scripture goes down to the 1800's. I think this is one of the conflicts inherent in religion: everyone of the same faith should follow the same scripture, but scripture, (and especially its interpretation), must be an ongoing, living thing, which inevitably leads to differences in scripture and interpretation across cultures.</td>\n",

Christianity evolved over 2000 years, while Judaism over longer period, without central authority and separated by geographical and political boundaries. For example, Christians of Roman and Persian Empires had limited contacts as those empires were hostile to each other. It is natural for slight differences to evolve. Differences in book names, order of books, presence or absence of some paragraphs or inclusion of Apocrypha do not make scriptures' contents different. On opposite it is interesting how same are scriptures in Judaism and Christian traditions taking into consideration all historical circumstances. So I say that all Christian traditions have the same Bible.\\n\\nAlso Mormon books do not make a variation of Christian scriptures as nor Mormons themselves neither mainstream denominations include Mormons into mainstream Christianity. Mormonism evolved from Christianity but there were numbers of other teachings producing their scriptures which are not included into this study (so far). For example, are Gnostic scriptures part of Christian scriptures? It is all stretchable and where is the boundary defining Christian scriptures? Koran contains a lot of pieces of New and Old Testaments. With same logic we could say that Koran is part of Christian scriptures because it evolved from them. \\n\\nIt would be interesting to read more on the books which are only in the Ethiopian Bible. Looks all of them are part of the Old Testament which would mean that they are older than 2000 years and have origin in Judaism. Interesting how Judaism is treating these books.</td>\n",

How much influence did Creeds,  theological arguments, and powerful Bishops and Emperors have in determining what became Christian Scripture? And who does that today, what specific forces?  Even the Pope seems to be humbly struggling with issues like that today. \\n\\nUntil the last few centuries most Christians didn't have a Bible and only knew it through the readings and interpretations presented in churches by their authoritative representatives and through the lives of people they lived with.  Today it seems that any person's interpretation of whatever Scriptures the individual chooses to acknowledge as meaningful and valuable for their life is a given unless that person admits to some other authority of interpretation, voluntarily.  Defining  a religious institution today is something quite different from defining religious literacy in terms of some type of faithful individual belief or a matter of conscience.\\n\\n  I keep getting confused because it seems we are asked to look at \"religion\" as a social structure as defined by social/cultural/state norms at the exclusion of a \"faithful\" orientation of meaning and value that each of us individually makes, i.e. the conscience by which we live. Doesn't the diverse interactions between these two interdependent forces make an important difference for what we're looking at and how we look?  It seems we are trying to look at theological/cultural structures without looking at theological (and philosophical?) concepts and the nature of individualism  which has traditionally been at the heart of anything called a \"religious orientation\" or \"religious literacy\" or \"religious conscience\" or \"religious consciousness\". Because of this, it's somewhat confusing to follow the course.  Something always seems missing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In the earlier ages of humanity, I think it made sense that a community held to the same beliefs. In fact, if you read through both Hebrew and Christian scripture, often times prohibitions and laws were made to ensure orthodoxy to a particular set of beliefs. One only needs to look to the book of Leviticus to see a number of priestly, or holy, laws that the Israelite community was required to live by at the risk of serious (sounding) consequences. The end of Leviticus chapter 18, the well-known section that prohibits male-on-male homoerotic acts, also prohibits child sacrifice and says this is the practice of the Canaanites who lived in the land of Israel before the Israelites. Paul even wrote restrictions to his churches implying that those who did certain things (like drink alcohol in excess, adultery, etc.) were doing so because it was a form of idol worship. The writer of the epistles of John also wrote of the antichrists who were Jewish Christians that believed differently than the Johannine church.\\n\\nThese restrictions to ensure that others held the same beliefs was due largely in part to the Israelites starting as a nomadic tribe that needed everyone to adhere to community standards. This was to ensure tribal mentality and commitment to caring for one another - to make sure the community grew rather than dissipated.\\n\\nWhile such a philosophy is not silly, that those in a community should share beliefs and scripture, we are permitted a luxury of community and shared beliefs through varied scriptures and varying beliefs. Even interfaith communities, like Unitarian Churches, can coexist and share and challenge beliefs from community members.  In short, today's culture does not necessitate commitment to the same exact scripture.</td>\n",

It is interesting for me to see the reduction of books in the Protestant bibles, given that these follow the disoveries of science that launched the Enlightenment.  So apocrypha, mystic writings without historical verification, gnostic elements are weeded out to allow for a more rational approach to the 'story of salvation'.  I find it most interesting to analyze what is left out, such as the gnostic gospels, for example and the Book of Enoch which has some science fiction type elements, alll of which challenge a canon built on tradition and orthodoxy.  The Ethiopian Bible probably incorporates some of these and its interesting mix of elements from the Old and New Testaments probably reflects the way these books came to me, from a variety of sources, in animated competition for space and belief.  I am of the mind that the canon should be re examined to allow for more diversity to shine through, and likely to reflect the way people were thinking in the early church.</td>\n",

Facing the fact that there are so many versions of Christianity forces me to wondering what is “Christian”? Therefore, for me who converted to Christian after grown up, there should be some kind of definition of Christian and its “orthodox” or “catholic” sacred scripture. I really need certain books or texts to be a “Christian” as a believer and/or practitioner, not as a student or a learner of religion. If you want to communicate with Non-Christian people or heathen, I think, they also need some kind of a definition, doctrine or scripture of Christian to recognize and understand us.

       "      <td>Wonderful question because I think this challenges the notion of a \"single\" Christianity versus Christianities.  The differing versions of scripture allows adherents to incorporate other texts into their philosophies.  In some cases, like the Maccabees books, don't pull different schools of thought too far apart; whereas, the book of Mormon is very challenging for Christian's to reconcile with other portions of scripture.\\n\\nI think Christians should celebrate their diversity.  If Jesus is the central figure, and he left no outline as to what should be considered \"Christian Scripture\", then adherents should be allowed to dictate their own thoughts.  I've often thought that contemporary texts should also be allowed (definitely contemporary to the apostolic fathers, as some of the texts from the 100-300s also contain some valuable insight into Christian thought).  Controversial though it may be, I think the Gospel of Thomas could generate further discussion among Christians despite the often Gnostic bend to some of the quotes.  I have read The Acts of Paul and Thecla and found it a very intriguing pro-feminist text (though I recognize there are other issues to the text).  Again, if the goal is to challenge and delve into the philosophy (at least, that's what I believe it should be), then this diversity should be embraced.</td>\n",

Paul often wrote regarding divisions and contentions in the church, a situation not conducive to unity. There is one Body, One Lord, One Saviour. Unity in love is the sign for the world at large that Christianity is true. Revelations  22:18 and 19 sternly warns against man adding or taking away from the \"words of this book\", which echoes Deuteronomy 4:2 \"Ye shall not add unto the word (Hebrew word Dhavar) which I command you,neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.\" 2 Peter 1:20 states scripture is not a matter of private interpretation, but is given by the Holy Spirit through men under the Spirit's control. He goes on to warn against false teachers bringing in \"damnable heresies,\" working to confuse Christians as well as to make money off them. However, a knowledge of apocryphal books is useful. Jude quotes a passage from Enoch, which is consistent with traditional teaching but not found in the generally accepted canon. Maccabbees is quite instructive regarding intertestament Hebrew history. So I would have to say that some books (with the totally fictional Infancy of Christ, etc.) have relevance as background material, although not useful for doctrine.</td>\n",

There's things by nature we reject because of the convenience of it to our life's, maybe the teachings are too strict or maybe there don't fit our mind set.

As I dove into the books of the Old Testament and New Testament Bible included in the Bible, and then some of the books that were left out... I felt some were included that were less worthy than some of those left out. Then looking into how the books deemed worthy for the Christian Bible as known today was selected, God would have needed to have his hand in that process to get what He wanted in there. That takes a lot of faith from my stand point. Also, as I look at all the various translations available and taught from today, there are some huge differences from one another. So again, faith is needed to trust what God wants communicated can and will be regardless of how many translations are created.

Do you think it is important that people belonging to the same tradition share the same scriptures?

But it is part of the honest church history so why not have them all, instead off subtracting some? My NSRV with Apocrypha contains I think all of the writings - except Mormons. \\n\\nAt risk of seeming to be exclusive, I would say that any writings added after that canonical period of time should be limited to the particular groups that utilize them. For example, The Mormons are their own branch/path BECAUSE of those writings, it (along with other things) makes them unique and different. Likewise if another Christian path branched off with new revealed writings, they would name themselves after that particular branch off. \\n\\nI do think its fine to focus on only certain aspects of the bible, but they should all be there for examining. Personally, I see Jesus as a man who came to change the current way the Law was being utilized, he came to 'fulfill' it by things he felt needed correction. He felt people weren't getting the message. They were missing the point, and it was due to those mistakes, the 'missing the point' that he died. He did not die FOR our sins in the sense of the word we normally use but BECAUSE of - so for me, myself, I would not be as focused on the OT, or on Revelations or other books written that have nothing to do with actual things Jesus was supposedly teaching. I still would like those scriptures available, but would not focus on them. Much the same as a more Evangelical person or Pentecostal would focus on parts I might not, but at least would have those same words available.</td>\n",

Wihout a single Canon that is believed to be \"God-breathed\", it seems hard to be able to proclaim what a Christian believes to be true with any certainty.

The Ethiopian bible, for instance, grew out of the circumstance that they are one of the oldest Christian communities and were quite isolated from other branches of the tradition for a long time.  It would seem unreasonable to ask them to give up  portions of their scripture in order to be in synch with most other Christians who differ greatly among themselves.\\nThe Bible has never seemed to me to be one thing.  It is a collection of books.  Some of those books are reproduced in versions meant for children, others are turned into Sunday morning cartoon versions.  The various books have been translated in various ways by people with particular agendas.  The Good News bible, for example, is meant for people who may struggle with some of the standard vocabulary,.\\nI live in a part of the world that seems to \"worship\" the King James version of the bible, which seems quite unreasonable as his translators did not have the skills in Greek and Aramaic that have led scholars to some of their interesting revisions.\\nI for one would consider the Bible to be a work in progress, that has variations that have meaning to various groups at various times.   \n",
       "5                          From an abstract standpoint, I think it is important that members of the same faith share the same scripture. In the introductory video scripture is defined as literature with unique authority; I think if two groups believe that they share the same faith but disagree on the source of divine authority there are obviously going to be conflicts. One of the reasons I phrased my answer in that way is that many individuals and denominations that consider themselves christians do not consider other denominations that do not share their bible christian. To me, the question kind of begs the question of wether the different faith traditions we are studying are the same religion at all, based purely on some degree of shared scripture. My question here is similar to one I was trying to answer in my original post; at what point does scripture become so different it is no longer christian at all? \\n\\nIn the concrete case of christianity, I think we need to look at the history behind the differentiation of the bible, as other comments have suggested. My understanding is that the bible was originally a set of books that circulated individually among early christian communities. I think that your decision about what books to use is a decision about how legitimate the editing process that brought us those books was. You could decide that all revelation circulated as a book of the bible in the years after jesus' death was divine, and see the dead sea scrolls as legitimate in the same way the letters of Paul are. Or you could decide that the church authorities who created the holy bible were divinely inspired, as you could with any other codification of the books of the bible. With mormonism this faith in divine inspiration of scripture goes down to the 1800's. I think this is one of the conflicts inherent in religion: everyone of the same faith should follow the same scripture, but scripture, (and especially its interpretation), must be an ongoing, living thing, which inevitably leads to differences in scripture and interpretation across cultures.    \n",

Christianity evolved over 2000 years, while Judaism over longer period, without central authority and separated by geographical and political boundaries. For example, Christians of Roman and Persian Empires had limited contacts as those empires were hostile to each other. It is natural for slight differences to evolve. Differences in book names, order of books, presence or absence of some paragraphs or inclusion of Apocrypha do not make scriptures' contents different. On opposite it is interesting how same are scriptures in Judaism and Christian traditions taking into consideration all historical circumstances. So I say that all Christian traditions have the same Bible.\\n\\nAlso Mormon books do not make a variation of Christian scriptures as nor Mormons themselves neither mainstream denominations include Mormons into mainstream Christianity. Mormonism evolved from Christianity but there were numbers of other teachings producing their scriptures which are not included into this study (so far). For example, are Gnostic scriptures part of Christian scriptures? It is all stretchable and where is the boundary defining Christian scriptures? Koran contains a lot of pieces of New and Old Testaments. With same logic we could say that Koran is part of Christian scriptures because it evolved from them. \\n\\nIt would be interesting to read more on the books which are only in the Ethiopian Bible. Looks all of them are part of the Old Testament which would mean that they are older than 2000 years and have origin in Judaism. Interesting how Judaism is treating these books.   \n",
       "27                                                   Do the Scriptures make the tradition or do people of faith make the tradition and the Scriptures? Do people live Christian lives in some specific,faithful  way or just create Christian social institutions to which they belong or have been forced to belong?  How much influence did Creeds,  theological arguments, and powerful Bishops and Emperors have in determining what became Christian Scripture? And who does that today, what specific forces?  Even the Pope seems to be humbly struggling with issues like that today. \\n\\nUntil the last few centuries most Christians didn't have a Bible and only knew it through the readings and interpretations presented in churches by their authoritative representatives and through the lives of people they lived with.  Today it seems that any person's interpretation of whatever Scriptures the individual chooses to acknowledge as meaningful and valuable for their life is a given unless that person admits to some other authority of interpretation, voluntarily.  Defining  a religious institution today is something quite different from defining religious literacy in terms of some type of faithful individual belief or a matter of conscience.\\n\\n  I keep getting confused because it seems we are asked to look at \"religion\" as a social structure as defined by social/cultural/state norms at the exclusion of a \"faithful\" orientation of meaning and value that each of us individually makes, i.e. the conscience by which we live. Doesn't the diverse interactions between these two interdependent forces make an important difference for what we're looking at and how we look?  It seems we are trying to look at theological/cultural structures without looking at theological (and philosophical?) concepts and the nature of individualism  which has traditionally been at the heart of anything called a \"religious orientation\" or \"religious literacy\" or \"religious conscience\" or \"religious consciousness\". Because of this, it's somewhat confusing to follow the course.  Something always seems missing.    \n",

In fact, if you read through both Hebrew and Christian scripture, often times prohibitions and laws were made to ensure orthodoxy to a particular set of beliefs. One only needs to look to the book of Leviticus to see a number of priestly, or holy, laws that the Israelite community was required to live by at the risk of serious (sounding) consequences. The end of Leviticus chapter 18, the well-known section that prohibits male-on-male homoerotic acts, also prohibits child sacrifice and says this is the practice of the Canaanites who lived in the land of Israel before the Israelites. Paul even wrote restrictions to his churches implying that those who did certain things (like drink alcohol in excess, adultery, etc.) were doing so because it was a form of idol worship. The writer of the epistles of John also wrote of the antichrists who were Jewish Christians that believed differently than the Johannine church.\\n\\nThese restrictions to ensure that others held the same beliefs was due largely in part to the Israelites starting as a nomadic tribe that needed everyone to adhere to community standards. This was to ensure tribal mentality and commitment to caring for one another - to make sure the community grew rather than dissipated.\\n\\nWhile such a philosophy is not silly, that those in a community should share beliefs and scripture, we are permitted a luxury of community and shared beliefs through varied scriptures and varying beliefs. Even interfaith communities, like Unitarian Churches, can coexist and share and challenge beliefs from community members.  In short, today's culture does not necessitate commitment to the same exact scripture.   \n",

I think this adds light to what I already believe, and depth.\\nAlso, who would decide WHICH of all of these scriptures gets chosen? If anyone, other than God and Jesus himself, then it would be like in times past when people were forced to listen to specific things (and in a specific language). \\nI believe there is value in the diversity we have, and believe everyone has a right to their own belief, and if they so wish, their own Bible translation, with or without the book they so wish.\\nI might add that I am trying to read books not contained in my own religion´s canon because I believe knowledge is priceless, regardless of its source.

It is interesting for me to see the reduction of books in the Protestant bibles, given that these follow the disoveries of science that launched the Enlightenment.  So apocrypha, mystic writings without historical verification, gnostic elements are weeded out to allow for a more rational approach to the 'story of salvation'.  I find it most interesting to analyze what is left out, such as the gnostic gospels, for example and the Book of Enoch which has some science fiction type elements, alll of which challenge a canon built on tradition and orthodoxy.  The Ethiopian Bible probably incorporates some of these and its interesting mix of elements from the Old and New Testaments probably reflects the way these books came to me, from a variety of sources, in animated competition for space and belief.  I am of the mind that the canon should be re examined to allow for more diversity to shine through, and likely to reflect the way people were thinking in the early church.   \n",

The reason why I’m embarrassed with this is connected with my identity as a “Christian” as Roman Catholic. To tell the truth, I converted to Christian, RC, when I was 27yers old and was a graduate school student from a Buddhist. I had grown up in Buddhist family tradition. Facing the fact that there are so many versions of Christianity forces me to wondering what is “Christian”? Therefore, for me who converted to Christian after grown up, there should be some kind of definition of Christian and its “orthodox” or “catholic” sacred scripture. I really need certain books or texts to be a “Christian” as a believer and/or practitioner, not as a student or a learner of religion. If you want to communicate with Non-Christian people or heathen, I think, they also need some kind of a definition, doctrine or scripture of Christian to recognize and understand us.

The differing versions of scripture allows adherents to incorporate other texts into their philosophies.  In some cases, like the Maccabees books, don't pull different schools of thought too far apart; whereas, the book of Mormon is very challenging for Christian's to reconcile with other portions of scripture.\\n\\nI think Christians should celebrate their diversity.  If Jesus is the central figure, and he left no outline as to what should be considered \"Christian Scripture\", then adherents should be allowed to dictate their own thoughts.  I've often thought that contemporary texts should also be allowed (definitely contemporary to the apostolic fathers, as some of the texts from the 100-300s also contain some valuable insight into Christian thought).  Controversial though it may be, I think the Gospel of Thomas could generate further discussion among Christians despite the often Gnostic bend to some of the quotes.  I have read The Acts of Paul and Thecla and found it a very intriguing pro-feminist text (though I recognize there are other issues to the text).  Again, if the goal is to challenge and delve into the philosophy (at least, that's what I believe it should be), then this diversity should be embraced.   \n",

Paul often wrote regarding divisions and contentions in the church, a situation not conducive to unity. There is one Body, One Lord, One Saviour. Unity in love is the sign for the world at large that Christianity is true. Revelations  22:18 and 19 sternly warns against man adding or taking away from the \"words of this book\", which echoes Deuteronomy 4:2 \"Ye shall not add unto the word (Hebrew word Dhavar) which I command you,neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.\" 2 Peter 1:20 states scripture is not a matter of private interpretation, but is given by the Holy Spirit through men under the Spirit's control. He goes on to warn against false teachers bringing in \"damnable heresies,\" working to confuse Christians as well as to make money off them. However, a knowledge of apocryphal books is useful. Jude quotes a passage from Enoch, which is consistent with traditional teaching but not found in the generally accepted canon. Maccabbees is quite instructive regarding intertestament Hebrew history. So I would have to say that some books (with the totally fictional Infancy of Christ, etc.) have relevance as background material, although not useful for doctrine.   \n",

I am a Christian and I believe the Bible contains the Word of God but I know that some scriptures are missing. I don't know the reasons for leaving out some books from the bible but I think it would be good to have them included, as long as they do not contradict the message of Jesus.\\n\\nIdeally people belonging to the same tradition should share the same scripture because the scripture to some extent shape the traditions practiced. However in Christianity, the religion was not founded upon the scriptures but rather upon the Person of Jesus, it is possible for diverse groups to be called 'Christians'. Where I live there is a group of Christians that do not use the bible; they depend on the Holy Spirit to lead them and direct them and most of their teachings are consistent with Christian teachings in the Bible.   \n",

I also know that even if we all used the same books and the same translation, we would still have very diverse interpretations of what the scriptures mean.  We live in different societies, we have different lifestyles, different upbringings, etc.  And different groups will emphasize different books or passages.  I'm sure there are books in the Protestant bible that I have never heard used in a sermon, for example.\\n\\nI also think that other books, not included in the canon can be holy and provide \"truths\" about God.  Just because it is not in the bible doesn't mean we shouldn't use it for religious teaching.  This is another way our diversity within Christianity shows up.     \n",

And I feel they are related.\\n\\nI was raised in Roman Catholic at a time when what was in the bible and what was to be believed was taught very strictly.  The bible was the word of God and it was not really open to interpretation.\\n\\nSo when I learned that different Christian religions had different books in their bibles and different interpretations of the books I found this disconcerting.\\n\\nIf it i the word of God then does that mean:\\n\\n- other religions believe in books that are not the word of God?\\n- that from their perspective Roman Catholics believe in books that aren't the word of God?\\n- if there is that much variation what is right?  Who is right?\\n\\nAn expression that became common later was \"ala carte Catholics\", people who chose to believe differnt  bits and pieces.  Often it seemed they believed the \"easy\" parts and ignored the \"hard \" parts.\\n\\nFrom what I read and hear a lot of Christian religions continue to feel very strongly that the bible is the word of God and that their interpretation of the bible is the correct one.  From what I see in these discussions a lot of people in this class seem to be pretty flexible, but that raises other questions:\\n\\n- are the people in this class representative of the people in their religions?\\n- if people are free to choose how they interpret the bible and it is different than other people in their religion and other religions than what is the word of God?\\n\\nSo I am interested in seeing how this class works out and what I learn. \\n\\n   \n",

Anybody can stand up and proclaim new scriptures or different with the idea that God revealed these ideas to them and with a body of people that follow these ideas establishes a new church.  There's things by nature we reject because of the convenience of it to our life's, maybe the teachings are too strict or maybe there don't fit our mind set.  If that's the case you can bet its happened already and there's something else out there that will interpret scripture better to fit you and delete what you didn't like about some other books and I think ultimately that is what has happened thru time.  We all hear the ideas that our particular branches are the \"true church\"  I hear it a lot where I attend.  What these scriptures are used for is ultimately up to the practicing Christian.  Some different churches believe in divine revelation while others don't and that in itself kind of explains the difference for some people.  Things were added or delivered by God in a sense.  I do believe that the diversity is good and would agree more to that simply because one way will never fit all, too many languages, translations and difference in cultures on the earth.     \n",

This means that any book that contradicts or strays from the basic message of the bible should be excluded from the canon. It's a strategy the church fathers used in their days to pick the books we call the new testament today.    \n",

It seems to come very close to the same idea of having some central statement of faith that kind of all could subscribe to.\\nThe bible in itself is a fascinating book. It seems, many have been writing, supposedlöy under the influence of the Holy Spirit.\\nMuch gets lost in translation, as some greek words for example have 3 or more meanings in a modern language like english or german. This has led to a renewed interest in knowing some greek, to be able to understand what a word means. Or there are several words for the word \"love\", distinguishing thus the way someone loves or is loved.\\n\\nThe differences in possible meaning have led to different translations with even impacting theological or dogmatic questions. \\n\\nBeing careful and wise in reading the bible seems thus necessary. Maybe it is, as a sacred scripture, only truly understandable to those led by the Sacred.   \n",

I do believe it is extremely powerful and holds much wisdom. I also think it is written by humans and therefore has some imperfections. Some of the biggest issues on top of that has to do with the canon of scripture. As I dove into the books of the Old Testament and New Testament Bible included in the Bible, and then some of the books that were left out... I felt some were included that were less worthy than some of those left out. Then looking into how the books deemed worthy for the Christian Bible as known today was selected, God would have needed to have his hand in that process to get what He wanted in there. That takes a lot of faith from my stand point. Also, as I look at all the various translations available and taught from today, there are some huge differences from one another. So again, faith is needed to trust what God wants communicated can and will be regardless of how many translations are created. Sometimes I feel all these added translations that come out are just one more opportunity to humans to taint the original message from God.   \n",
       "132  I do believe that by and large most Christians believe in the same books. There are various translations though. Various Bibles have some additional  books. I am a Mormon and we have an additional scripture the Book of Mormon which we believe is another testament of Jesus Christ. Just as much as I believe in this book to be true I would like for all to read any of the available scriptures and rely on the Lord to endow them with spirit of discernment to know of the things of the Lord. The current books in the Bible have been taken from hundreds and thousands of ancient manuscripts. Many early leaders like Wycliff, Calvin., Erasmus, William Tyndale, Luther etc have fought for scriptures to be made available for common people.Tyndale vowed, “If God spare my life, ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the plough, shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost!”.He was strangled and burned at the stake.\\nMany thousands of people were burnt at the stake or martyred for processing the English Bible. People of ages have been hungry for scriptures. I would like to pay homage to all these people. But there are many things that we still do not know. Though the idea of one book sounds good it is not possible as the Lord is a respecter of people and has given us freedom to choose. He would like for us to gain as much knowledge as possible and will never let us go astray as we strive to be diligent and rely on Him to know the truth. As is said in James 1:5 \" In any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him\".\\n I do believe that there are many things or scriptures we still do not know and many more to come in the future and the key is to keep the communication with the Lord open.\\nhttps://www.lds.org/ensign/2011/08/400-years-of-the-king-james-bible?lang=eng\\nhttps://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/07/how-the-bible-came-to-be-part-6-no-price-too-great?lang=eng\\nhttps://www.lds.org/ensign/1992/08/news-of-the-church/first-presidency-statement-on-the-king-james-version-of-the-bible.p1?lang=eng   \n",

Do you think it is important that people belonging to the same tradition share the same scriptures?  Why or why not?\\n\\nIf the bible was going to contain all the same teachings then it should be the bible with the most included scriptures - Ethiopic and whatever others if that one does not contain them all. \\n\\nFrom there, notes can be made as to which writings particular groups fixate on the most. But it is part of the honest church history so why not have them all, instead off subtracting some? My NSRV with Apocrypha contains I think all of the writings - except Mormons. \\n\\nAt risk of seeming to be exclusive, I would say that any writings added after that canonical period of time should be limited to the particular groups that utilize them. For example, The Mormons are their own branch/path BECAUSE of those writings, it (along with other things) makes them unique and different. Likewise if another Christian path branched off with new revealed writings, they would name themselves after that particular branch off. \\n\\nI do think its fine to focus on only certain aspects of the bible, but they should all be there for examining. Personally, I see Jesus as a man who came to change the current way the Law was being utilized, he came to 'fulfill' it by things he felt needed correction. He felt people weren't getting the message. They were missing the point, and it was due to those mistakes, the 'missing the point' that he died. He did not die FOR our sins in the sense of the word we normally use but BECAUSE of - so for me, myself, I would not be as focused on the OT, or on Revelations or other books written that have nothing to do with actual things Jesus was supposedly teaching. I still would like those scriptures available, but would not focus on them. Much the same as a more Evangelical person or Pentecostal would focus on parts I might not, but at least would have those same words available.    \n",

Many of the non-canonical books that are mentioned were discarded by the early Church because they were outside the pale of orthodoxy. In fact, we have seen a resurgence of scholarship that has tried to include some of the gnostic gospels. The reason that they were dismissed in the past and the reason they will continue to be disregarded by the vast majority of Christians today is that they do not accurately represent what the early Church believed to be true. Wihout a single Canon that is believed to be \"God-breathed\", it seems hard to be able to proclaim what a Christian believes to be true with any certainty. The Professor accurately notes that Christians worship and practice their faith in a variety of ways. However, it is my belief that on essentiail doctrine, the church should have a monolithic Canon.   \n",

What we have also come to realize is that by destroying the viewpoints of others (whether burning books or denying ancestral worship) those in power do not in the end achieve their goal of uniformity or control.  These ideas have a way of resurfacing, often for the good of humanity.  I think of the Roman Catholic Church's attempts to erase the role of women as priests and teachers in the beginning of Christianity.  In the end, scholars have found their way to the truth.  And even beyond definitions of truth, having different scriptures tells us what we don't know, and need to continually learn.  I am delighted to see understanding of the Cosmic Christ/Logos/Ein Sof....as poetic license in the search for the divine.  Not knowing opens the door to learning more, and to humility that allows this knowledge to grow.   \n",

I won't go to the extent to judge anyone but I feel that a lot of context can get lost by adding or ignoring some of the content and textual content.</td>\n",

Diversity also limits the action of man's interference in attempting to insert into the sacred scriptures elements that may lead the reader's faith to one or another doctrine.</td>\n",

All Christians share the most \"important\" books of the Bible.

Absolutely.  Because the discord within Christianity - so many thousands of sects already (and they continually proliferate), indicates that there must be major misunderstandings about what Jesus actually taught and why, which has caused so many divergent dogmas and approaches.  Surely this is one of the major problems within the religion.     \n",

As i have seen there are many common books that all Christians (including Mormons) share, this have contributed to a more common core beliefs among Christians about God, Jesus and Prophets. However, as pointed out by other learners above, the diversity of scriptures may be attributed to theological, dogmatic or political influences of the days when the scriptures were being compiled. \\n\\nThis diversity among denominations might give insights into their different attitudes towards their faith and the world around them.   \n",

Consulting other bibles might be one way of doing that as well as consulting non-biblical sources such as biblical archeology.  Violence and schisms within a religion occur when people refuse to consider modifying a belief system even in the face of overwhelming change within their environment.  \\n\\nI think we are seeing this at present in the USA.  We have groups who insist that politicians support and enforce very narrow religious views even when a majority of citizens do not support those views.  Contraception and Women's Reproductive Rights is just one example; there are many, many more.</td>\n",

It involves complex consideration of theological concepts and variations in practices, historical, political, cultural and other circumstances. It might be easier for the international Christian community if the Bible is one, unified text. However, I think that is impossible to achieve. It has to be some reason why some texts are canonical for one group of Christians but excluded from other versions of the Bible. You cannot make one group of Christians to abandon their beliefs in validity of certain books excluded from other versions, and you can hardly make other groups to accept other texts in addition to what they already have because those texts were not included to their version of the Bible before for some reason. This  reason may be already outdated  (like some political circumstances, for instance) or may be still valid (as some canonical differences in religious practices or liturgy).  General practitioners may not be aware of those reasons and differences, but I'm sure the clergy do. \\nI was raised in Ukraine in Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. At some point I found it interesting to find online and read some books not included into the Orthodox Bible. But I have never done more research on why they are not included.

Now, however, I realize this is a sign of internal diversity within the same religion.  In addition, reading the Resources for Additional Learning from Day 1 offered a segment from Douglas Jacobsen's \"The World's Christians\" which explains that Christianity is united by a number of factors - the idea that Jesus is human and divine, the Trinity, that salvation is a gift from God, the opportunity for weekly worship, baptism as a rite of initiation, and the Eucharist - although not everyone believes in transubstantiation. In addition, as we learned today, \"all Christian Bibles\" are based on the Tanakh. Thus, although I am still adjusting to the idea that Christianity contains so many different Bibles, I do not believe that the same religions must share the exact same scriptures, for they share other common factors that place them under the umbrella of Christian or whatever other religion we may discuss.</td>\n",

Consulting other bibles might be one way of doing that as well as consulting non-biblical sources such as biblical archeology.  Violence and schisms within a religion occur when people refuse to consider modifying a belief system even in the face of overwhelming change within their environment.  \\n\\nI think we are seeing this at present in the USA.  We have groups who insist that politicians support and enforce very narrow religious views even when a majority of citizens do not support those views.  Contraception and Women's Reproductive Rights is just one example; there are many, many more.   \n",
       "4    As it has been noticed here, the Bible is not a book but a collection of books. It is important to understand why some book were included or excluded from the different versions. It involves complex consideration of theological concepts and variations in practices, historical, political, cultural and other circumstances. It might be easier for the international Christian community if the Bible is one, unified text. However, I think that is impossible to achieve. It has to be some reason why some texts are canonical for one group of Christians but excluded from other versions of the Bible. You cannot make one group of Christians to abandon their beliefs in validity of certain books excluded from other versions, and you can hardly make other groups to accept other texts in addition to what they already have because those texts were not included to their version of the Bible before for some reason. This  reason may be already outdated  (like some political circumstances, for instance) or may be still valid (as some canonical differences in religious practices or liturgy).  General practitioners may not be aware of those reasons and differences, but I'm sure the clergy do. \\nI was raised in Ukraine in Eastern Orthodox Christian tradition. At some point I found it interesting to find online and read some books not included into the Orthodox Bible. But I have never done more research on why they are not included. I hope to get more answers on this questions about scriptural variations from this course.    \n",

Now, however, I realize this is a sign of internal diversity within the same religion.  In addition, reading the Resources for Additional Learning from Day 1 offered a segment from Douglas Jacobsen's \"The World's Christians\" which explains that Christianity is united by a number of factors - the idea that Jesus is human and divine, the Trinity, that salvation is a gift from God, the opportunity for weekly worship, baptism as a rite of initiation, and the Eucharist - although not everyone believes in transubstantiation. In addition, as we learned today, \"all Christian Bibles\" are based on the Tanakh. Thus, although I am still adjusting to the idea that Christianity contains so many different Bibles, I do not believe that the same religions must share the exact same scriptures, for they share other common factors that place them under the umbrella of Christian or whatever other religion we may discuss.    \n",

With historical and regional differences, varied translations and widely diverse interpretations the variability is easily understood.\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that we are so unaware of scriptural differences. It makes me want to know who decides, how they decide and the historical events impacting those decisions. If we believe the Bible is the word of God why are there so many variations?  What  other texts are missing, or has some editors mislabeled the texts as sacredness/not sacred? Obviously I need to learn much more as I have more questions than answers.   \n",

In his book “The Future of Faith”, former Harvard Prof. Harvard Cox points out that “original” Christianity was highly diverse.  There were many “gospels” and “scripture” that were used by the various congregations in the early church.   Canonization happened in the 4th Century C.E. as a program sponsored by the church hierarchy, under the auspices of the Roman Emperor. \\n\\nFrom my view, although the canonization of the Christian Bible established a certain “standardization” (not withstanding the differences of its various sects), the suppression of sacred texts “de-enriched” the tradition.  \\n\\nWorse yet, by putting a “back cover” on the Bible, it has tended to constrain the development of the faith as new understanding and knowledge emerge (or is “revealed”).   \n",

I was particularly surprised that the Catholic and Protestant bibles are different.  \\nI had to give a lot of thought on the question \" Do you think it is important that people belonging to the same tradition share the same scriptures\" .  In the end I decided that the scripture doesn't need to be exactly the same as long as it carries the same message.  Within the protestant bible, which I think may be the smallest, there are many conflicting messages so adding more books to the bible won't likely add additional confusion.\\nIn some cases, the additional scriptures are added to offer perspective on the historic books of the bible. For example, within the mormon faith, the Book of Mormon is additional information to accompany the traditional bible.  In the Christian Science faith, The Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures is an additional text that gives further insight into the bible form that perspective.\\nThese additional books or scriptures do not detract from the bible but add additional information or context.  I guess the difficulty is in the determination of \"sacred\" and how one would determine if any or all is really the \"word of God\"   \n",

As we know that the writers of the Bible wrote at different times over a period of 1500 years thus making it the most unique book ever written. While it is still debatable as to why some books were included in the Bible AND some weren't, i believe there is factor that need to be included in the discussion and the \"God factor\". Since Bible was inspired writings, inspired by God, the inclusion and exclusion of the books of the Bible should also bear the \"inspired\" mark. History records for us the early church fathers under the inspiration had set \"marks of approval\" as to which books should be part of the holy cannon. Some of these standards were: (1)The writings should have been read by more than one group of people, spread across different regions. (2) The writings should have inspired the readers back then. \\nI hope this gives us some foundation.   \n",

A foundational basis that remains the same throughout the various readings. However, some may have added scripture that is important to that culture or maybe that scripture is an integral part of where the population came from. In my last course, Dr. Moore spoke of situatedness and how it can make the practice of a religion look so different depending on what an individual's situatedness is, I think the same applies to the writings.    \n",

One could argue that if Christianity is a revealed religion, why would different schools accept having potentially contradictory texts or potential books that are not considered 'revealed' or 'inspired' by God. However, the issue then is how were these books canonised? Was there political interference involve? Did valuable books get left out because they were deemed, by the those compiling them, to be redundant, but would have been good in today's age?\\n\\nOf course, the other side would be that any religion or ideology, will never be a one size fits all, different cultures; nations; histories; languages; geography and location will all have an impact on how a religion or ideology develops whether people like this or not. Thus, in this context, what fits one of the Christian communities, will not neseccarily fit another.   \n",

I think that the core canon - 66 books - should be shared among denominations of the same religion.  However, as far as the non-canonical books, as long as their historical provenance can be determined, I think that should be up to the individual believer.  Even the early Church fathers noted that they could be useful for instruction and edification, just not part of the canon.  However, I think if a book has been shown to contradict the others in large ways, or if it is shown to be dated far from when it says it was, etc., then I think it should be rejected.    \n",

Rather than Catholics, Protestants of various denominations, and so on, there were Lukians and Markians and Johnians, or whatever the imaginary case may be. Each with their own gospel, but all worshiping the same God, embracing the same Jesus as savior, drawing on slightly different versions of the same basic narrative. It seems to me that even then, we would tend to think of these distinct sects as nonetheless sharing a common tradition.\\n\\nNaturally, we'd expect a shared text or collection of texts.

The Catholic Church determined much of what is accepted as the foundational cannon.  I believe one must have accepted common ground to build upon.  It becomes difficult however when conflicting cannons are added to religions which identify under the same “label” or tradition. (Not to say wrong, just difficult)\\nIt is my personal perspective that the Gospels are the foundation of Christian faith, followed by Acts and then the Letters and Revelations, followed by the Old Testament to give the much needed history and foundation. The additional scriptures fall in the latter categories. But that's me.\\n   \n",

It's bound to happen, in my opinion, but as others have noted as well, there is significant overlap, so the additions or omissions aren't all that many. I think also that with different traditions come different content when it's a textual content not having been written by the figurehead. When it's context being written by his followers after Jesus, I think it offers up the ability for variety and context of stories through the eyes of those that wrote them. I think that it's important for people belonging to the same tradition to share some scriptures, but I don't think it's an all or nothing scenario.   \n",

I think it is good to include the scriptures that some may consider less important and omitted for the purpose of personal or social justifications.

Even though they may share the same books, each version is slightly different due to translations or rewording, usually for political purposes. Subtle changes within each book can alter the meaning of the text as a whole. \\n\\nWhen people believe so strongly in their faith that they take the text as literal truth, word choice matters greatly. Different texts lead to different interpretations which in turn lead to different beliefs. Common understanding is key for cooperation and peace.   \n",

If scriptures are considered extremely important, something read and referenced and interpreted on a regular basis, then it is obviously more important that everyone share the same ones. But even then, the importance varies dependent on how wide a definition of \"tradition\" we are using. \\n\\nObviously, it is not necessary for all Christians to share the same scriptures, because they do not, and have not for centuries. They do, however share *some* of their scriptures, and these are the ones deemed most important in Christianity as a whole: the New Testament, and the Hebrew Tanakh. The other books, which some Bibles contain and others omit, are considered less important in terms of being a Christian, but still significant in terms of defining what sect or church one belongs to.    \n",

Why would God reveal something to one area of the world or group of people?  My personal study of the protestant texts revealed inconsistencies in the way it was taught and interpreted and it has made me question its divinity, especially regarding the authority on how the books were combined and proposed as Truth.   \n",

I know that many Protestant faiths do not consider any of the other sects of Christianity to be, in fact, Christian. I believe that there should be continuity in scripture within one religion, having been raised Protestant. However, I do not think that people who use other scriptures necessarily have any less basis in Christianity as what it really means is to be a follower of Christ. It's a difficult tension, one that makes this type of study so rewarding but also so necessary.   \n",

Additionally, as I believe in revelation, the understanding of passages is subject to shifts in meaning or understanding. \\n\\nShould there be one book everybody refers to? probably, yes.

In a way, the answer simply depends on practice.  We don't have to know why Protestants and Catholics use different versions, but simply that they **do**.   Equally important is the questions of customs.  Many, but not all, Christians engage in similar liturgies; again, this is a question of what they do.   \n",

Christian share many of the same basic fundamental beliefs, but tend to vary after a while due to being part of different cultures, languages and  physical separation from each other. Each part of this faith share a basic grounding, but may hold a slightly different doctrine. A Baptist church with a parish made up of upper middle class and upper class white professionals will share the same belief as an inner city baptist African American church working class church, but of course will worship in a very different manner. I think this same type of difference is reflected on a larger scale by holding to different pieces of scripture over time. Both hold to the exact same basic \"truth.\"     \n",

How we understand every text is singular, so I understand that every tradition had they own bible, because this singular parity had happen in the past too. Not only political, power relationship, ethical  and moral decisions participate in the differences, the particular mind of the persons who decided which ones are good for the tradition or not, and they own experience with every text were important elements.     \n",

Scripture needs to have versions to suit cultural context. Jesus spoke to the people of his time using the language and stories of the time to connect and teach people on their own terms. I beleive Jesus would encourage the manipulation of scriptures in order for his message to be understood.   \n",
