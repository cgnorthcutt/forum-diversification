       "{0: [u\"The birth narratives are widely different,.so much so that some people have produced their own Gospel by trying to reconcile them, it dosen't work. You can say that they are so different because the memories of the people who reported on theses events knew of certain facts that the other group did not, or you can say they are an attempt by each author to proclaim the divine origin of Jeshua, as the Messiah that would come from the house of David as foretold  in their scriptures, or you can say they were just completely made up..Now these problems were well known to early Christian Apologists, yet they elected to keep both accounts, so maybe they knew something we do not?  I think these divergent birth stories tell as more about the authors and their community beliefs than they tell us about Jeshua1\",\n",
       "  u'DAD, good points... in agreement. One point for reflection- while the four gospels existed by the end of the first century (or early in the second century if you take the latter date arguments for John), they were not necessarily available to all the communities.Many communities seem to have only one or two versions together with other writings, epistles, etc. until later in the 2nd and 3thr centuries. This argument is supported by what seems to be the absence in early Christian sermons, and writings of multiple Gospels as sources. The Church fathers seem to be limited in the number of Gospels each individual quotes. It is possible that by the time the Apologist come around as the new common orthodoxy was being established, that different communities were very familiar with one  of the accounts and may have reject a new one. It would have been easier to adopt the four and argue common ground than to claim one as superior or more true. We can see a gleam of this in Ignatius of Antioch letter arguing for the acceptance of the Gospel of John and the inclusion of the community that authored and was very familiar with this Gospel. ',\n",
       "  u\"You did make some very good points. Different communities would have accepted/related to different versions and thus their interpretations might have been different. As we look at these beautiful pictures, I am reminded of the paintings of the Last Supper. They differ due to the artist's thought process, perceptions and beliefs. Some material may have been added to entice believers to follow their perspective or belief. Or, it may be just artistic license/freedom coming into play. \",\n",
       "  u'The different worshipping communities having different stories makes sense and explains why all needed to be preserved in order to have a catholic, or united, church. ',\n",
       "  u'Yet in the Diatessaron there was balance in a way of showing elements of the stories in one text.  In fact, there is a lot in the painting that represents our stories of the Nativity told today, stories that include the shepherds and the kings all in one story as well as other elements.  ',\n",
       "  u'Great point of view. I believe that the fact of the four Gospels tell different stories about the birth of Jesus,  the communities took a mix of theses stories to criate its own birth  of Jesus. ',\n",
       "  u'Images were likely far more important in the past when most people could not read, many medieval churches have every square centimeter covered in art it was the religious equivalent of a comic strip. I agree with you  Jonalu art likely helped unify ideas beliefs and so consolidate political power.  '],\n",
       " 1: [u'I love nativity scenes and I guess I could say that I collect them.   I have NEVER thought of them as interpretations of the gospels and what each gospel says!  I love that thought!If someone were to read only one gospel they just would not have the full picture that they would have if they read Matthew Mark and Luke together.  These stories are fairly easy to harmonize together, maybe because they are so familiar to all of us.  Besides the nativity scenes they are also harmonized through carols.',\n",
       "  u'I love the outdoor nativities with people dressed as shepherds and wise men and live animals.  The nativity as a social form is quite new in America.   Until about 1820-30 almost no one  celebrated Christmas, put up Christmas trees or Nativities.   In New England it wasn\\'t celebrated  and in other places it was a alcohol infused period with lots of gun shooting.  I think most of our traditions come from European immigrants in the middle 19th century...the poem \"Night Before Christmas\"  and Queen Victoria\\'s Christmas trees  tamed the wild American Christmas  into a family holiday.

       " 4: [u\"Almost every children's Christmas pageant is a mini Diatessaron, and it comes as a surprise to most children that the Christmas story they know and love is not a single story but a combination of elements from Matthew and Luke. The two versions complement one another, Matthew being told from Joseph's perspective and Luke centered upon Mary. Matthew makes a connection between the Christ story and the Mosaic exodus from Egypt. Luke, with the shepherds, uses the kingly language of shepherd and sheep to reverse the flow of power. The Kingdom of God is rooted among the lowly.Neither story, I must add, says that Mary was perpetually virgin. The emphasis upon virginity in the early church must speak to a sexual politic in the ancient world. I am Christian, have studied church history and read a number of texts, and still find myself in the presence of an alien sensibility.  How can what is untouched ever become wise?\",\n",
       "  u'I think the important thing about Mary is that she is faithful. As time will prove she is also courageous. Virgin is something that was put in due to Roman Emperor claim the he was  born of virgin.  Every mother should have the hope of Mary for their children - that they will bring justice to the world.',\n",
       "  u'I like you comment: \"children\\'s Christmas pageant is a mini Diatessaron\". I never looked at it that way, as a harmonization of Matthew and Luke. ',\n",
       "  u\"No, the emphasis upon Mary's virginity (only up to the time of Jesus's birth) was essential in order to convince the people that Jesus was actually the son of God.  By process of elimination.  If he didn't have a human father, then God must have been the father.  This was at the cost of making Joseph's genealogy, and the tie to the OT prophecies, an absurd and pointless detour.  But is was more important for Jesus to be believed to be a son of God than for him to be believed to have been a descendant of Abraham or whatever.Tatian's asceticism and his claim that Mary was a virgin for a longer time was, as the reading showed, way off the main track of orthodoxy.\",\n",
       "  u'It is common in methologies of antiquity for deities to be born of virgens. Christianity was just adopting an expected narrative for Jesus. ',\n",
       "  u'The word used to describe Mary, \"virgin\" simply means a young girl. The church had to turn the fact that she was unmarried AND with a child into something more pure (plus as the church established itself, it became very has patriarchal), because according to both the First and Second Testaments (e.g. the Law of Moses and John 7), a woman would deserve being stoned to death! ',\n",
       "  u\"Almost every children's Christmas pageant is a mini Diatessaron Great way to put it!\",\n",
       "  u\"A Christian takes the virgin birth as face value.  Read Matthew 1 to see why Joseph chose not to have Mary 'stoned to death'.\",\n",
       "  u\"I do agree that the Nativity story is an harmonization of the narratives of the two gospels. For me what is more important is the message of Jesus' humble birth. One can also examine the significance of the different animals together in the same space. This could possibly suggest Jesus' message of peace and love for each other. It's all a matter of interpretation.  \",\n",
       "  u'I very much agree!',\n",
       "  u\"I love your comment about every children's Christmas pageant is a mini-Diatessaron. So true as they always seem to include the same elements of a humble dwelling and resting place for the baby, angels, animals. wise men, Mary and Joseph, serenity, and joy.  \",\n",
       "  u'Intersting comment about Christmas pageants.  I always thought of of the text as coming directly from Luke, but can see how/where Matthew was brought into the mix, as well.',\n",
       "  u\"Mary is a beautiful example of the stages of discipleship, from her early embrace of the angel's announcement through her presence at Pentecost. She becomes wiser through her experiences of her son's ministry which often breaks her protective maternal heart. Thank you for bringing up the perpetual virginity aspect. That was an argument I had regularly with my teachers in Roman Catholic schools. That couldn't explain away Matthew 1:25 or regular mention in the gospels of brothers and sisters.\",\n",
       "  u'It is indeed surprising that a Christmas story so very well known to many Christians since childhood \"is not a single story but a combination of elements from Matthew and Luke\". This is really amazing. ',\n",

       " 5: [u\"No manger story in Matthew but the wise men from the east pay a visit to the family home in Nazareth.  Thus the tradition of the three kings who were probably Zoroaster Priests/astronomers from Persia current day Iran. The family escapes to Egypt as Herod slaughters all males two years old and under. This is contrasted by Luke's detailed account of the entire commentary surrounding the birth of Jesus with shepherds angels and hints of a barn. Mark and John offer no account of Jesus' birth. Most Christians, like myself, have no problem harmonizing the conflicting birth accounts. When my wife and I visited several Coptic churches in Egypt we discovered a very rich tradition of the Holy families stay there. I'm sure they prefer the Matthew account of the Lord's birth.\",\n",
       "  u\"Most Christians, like myself, have no problem harmonizing the conflicting birth accounts. I see your point. Respect for your visit to the Coptic Church of Egypt. Personally, I don't need to harmonize the stories but enjoy them as they are and be encouraged by message they each portray in their own. Cheers! Fiseha \",\n",
       "  u\"I believe you meant to say the wise men visited them in Bethlehem, not Nazareth. I am a Christian,and I don't pretend to speak for most Christians, but the two accounts of the birth and subsequent events are so widely  divergent that their is NO way they can be harmonized. You can justify one account, but not the other if you just read the text as written. Both can't be true, So one is true, or neither is true, as defined by Historical accuracy....  On the basis of  faith, however, I concede that  anything is possible!\",\n",
       "  u\"Yes, it's odd that neither Mark nor John have a birth narrative of Jesus, and that the typical pictures of the nativity include both shepherds (from Luke) and wise men (from Matthew).\"],\n",
       " 6: [u\"I have to admit that most Nativity scenes I see these days leave me cold compared to the fantastic artisitic representations we have over time from the great and not-so-great painters who can infuse the scene with a wide variety of meanings (Mary's love for her child, the presence of so many animals, the expressions on faces, etc).  The other kind of nativity scenes I enjoy are those that depict current day situations that would reflect some part of the nativity (immigrants, those fleeing persecution, humble birthplaces, the joy of a new son in the midst of the agony of being outside in a stable). I also have to admit that I don't have much appreciation for the harmonized versions of the gospels - they destroy both the literary and theological beauty of each on its own and, in fact, they don't always harmonized, nor should they as the differences reflect what Jesus and his ministry might mean to different audiences.\",\n",

       " 9: [u'when we look at paintings or nativity scenes through our modern lense, we tend to think of them as supplementary. literacy and access to scripture is something we take for granted. We forget that this was not the case throughout history. Some of the paintings, diaramas, statues and icons served an important role in providing visual context to remember the oral reading of scripture. The nativity scenes we have in our own house  served to provide a context for the stories we read to my Kids when they were young. Honestly, at first, I questioned weather or not to have them in the house because they could be interpreted as \"graven images\".  I also had a problem with the nativity depicting the birth of Jesus and the wise men bringing gifts to the manger, which likely happened when Jesus was older. In the end, we decided to display them and it  gave me an opportunity to discuss the story of the wise men in context with them. ',\n",

I had so much reverence for them as if it was in some way interpreting the wholly Scriptures. In time, I compared and contrasted the message as presented in the iconography and the written scripture. I resolved that the icons and arts invite me to participate in imagining as everyone else and is not really a help for me to understand what the authentic message is. If you think there is no authentic message, then I withdraw my point. For me, I think there is an authentic message that should be carefully transmitted but we are all free imagine it in a way that we can express what we have understood for which we are each take responsibility.

       "  u'literacy and access to scripture is something we take for grantedVery good point.

       " 10: [u\"Allow me to respectfully disagree on this point. Whether it is the nativity scene of Jesus\\u2019s birth or any other art of aesthetic value I don't see it as instructive of understanding the Gospels. First of all because it is a localized cultural meaning that is rooted in the interpretation of the single artist. Second, the artist belongs to a certain cultural milieu to which I do not belong. The only universality of the art is its aesthetic value and not its interpretation of the Gospel. It is puzzling to me to continually see that the academic approach to Christianity is loaded with so much burden that understanding Christianity in itself does not require. Thanks for the invitation to notice small models in homes, life-size exhibits at churches (meaning buildings), or through live staged enactments. This is not Christianity understood from Scriptures. This is Christianity in the imaginations of people interested in the subject matter. I cannot consider the drawings as interpretations of the gospel narratives even when the artist picked his/her inspiration from the written word. The communicated their own specific imaginations and are rarely faithful to any text as any artist will do. They are not required to do so. They must be given the freedom to freely imagine and freely express themselves. This is not a realm of historical instruction of the message once delivered to us through ancient manuscript. They give us the Jesus of their own imagination to which we are free to agree or disagree. Whatever position we take, we cannot but admire the art and skill. We each have no choice but to read gospel independently. Even when we have a priestly or scholarly guidance the intent of the Gospel is to be read and understood independently. The effort to harmonize is another interesting endeavor on our part to satisfy our curiosity. At the end of the day, we still have variations and we cannot absolutely eliminate the apparent inconsistencies. I've learned to read each Gospel independently. The Gospel tells the story of how Jesus began his ministry. There is a misunderstanding to read this 'beginning' as 'the beginning' of some new 'religion'. The Gospels testify to the truth that Jesus began to fulfill what has been foretold earlier. Therefore, the Gospels are not new beginnings but the fulfillment of various promises. Many art works, European artists in particular have bought into the idea of replacement of the Jewish system by the Christian system. That is what is wrong with contemporary Christianity, to begin with. To use their art to understand Christianity is to perpetuate the distortion. Allow me to enjoy the art but I will find my instruction elsewhere when it comes to historical accuracy and message. Fiseha  See the power of art even when it depicts a false notion. \",\n",
       "  u'This is a great post and if time permits, I will comment on your argument. I may come back at a later date to respond in more detail. Your points are well laid out but I need to review your premise and conclusions as my gut is telling me that these nativity depictions can be useful in understanding the Gospels - Christianity is full of art (painting and music) that provide a different dimension and can complement the texts associated with Christianity. Cheers.',\n",
       "  u'For those who believe that Jesus came to offer justification and therefore salvation to all who believed in him, we further this purpose by any artifact or gesture or act which encourages others to such a belief.  It could be a piece of writing, painting, sculpture, or whatever.  I think many artists share this sense of purpose.  A profound knowledge of the Gospels is not required in order to achieve belief.  Some may reach belief by hearing a few words and seeing a wonderful image.',\n",
       "  u\"Christian art like Christian literature reflects the religious  interpretations of the communities/individuals  that created it.

Whether the omission and commission are intentional or not, this could lead to distortion rather than interpretation.',\n",
       "  u\"Interesting thesis, FDLetta. Back to the first module of this course, written scripture is a very Western way of thinking about scripture.  Some of the art - not all, but some - do seem to be attempting to tell the full story, not just serve as devotional representations of the artist's belief or understanding.  Particularly for those who were illiterate, oral teachings and those through art and music may have been a primary way the scriptures were transmitted.\"],\n",
       " 11: [u'I grew up Anglican and as for as long as I can remember, at the Christmas Eve midnight mass, the Gospel reading is always Luke; Mary giving birth in a manger, the mention of angels, shepherds, angels. In the other readings, we hear about Herod and the Wise Men. As a result, the nativity scene is a strong symbol of Jesus\\u2019s birth. Every Christmas, a nativity scene can be found in our house. The various paintings also convey that sense of joy with birth, a peaceful setting, a time for a moment of reflection during a hectic time, the joy of parents with the birth of a child. This is a foreshadow of things to come. I find that I am learning more about the Gospels in this course that I learned growing up (a sad commentary about my education I suppose). I have only now noticed that of the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke are the only ones that mention in some detail,  the birth of Jesus. The other two don\\u2019t. I think this is consistent with the realizations that the most important part of the Christian church year, is not Christmas (his birth), rather it is Easter (his death and resurrection). So while the nativity scene conveys a \\u201cwarm and fuzzy\\u201d feeling that Christians (and many non-Christians I think) associate with Christmas, the real story is about the Passion of Christ as celebrated during Easter.I am not sure I responded to the questions asked in this discussion \\u2026.

Jesus deserves and receives human love from the beginning.Whatever the visual treatment of Jesus (generally he is shown as much more mature than a newborn) his nature as a human is emphasized.  In keeping with the Gospels, the nativities in no way suggest that as a baby (or at all prior to his public ministry) Jesus exercised special powers.His divine origin and stature is conveyed by the wise men or shepherds, the star.All of these are elements of Jesus\\'s persona that are revered by Christians.  The reading of any Gospel or Gospels and the viewing of any nativity are relevant and valuable religiously only insofar as they result in or strengthen belief in Jesus as the Son of God who offers justification to those who believe.  It is impossible to say which materials can be most effective for whom in achieving this result.',\n",

Most of the images that come to mind, at least in Western Christianity, find their origins in Medieval Europe, and reflect the imaginations of the artists of that period.  What they do have in common, though is an image of Jesus born into poverty, placed in a manger, rather than in a comfortable home.  This reflects the Christian belief that Jesus represents a break from the expectations of the Old Testament, a radical rethinking of the meaning of salvation history.  Christians not only believe that God came to dwell among us in Jesus, but that he did so in just about the most unlikely way possible.\",\n",

Paintings, models and Christmas card scenes often show all sorts of elements together that would have happened at different times, or show elements of the society they come from. Medieval and Renaissance paintings used both of these techniques to show a complete representation of everything that happened or might have happened, and also show things familiar to the viewer from their own times. So paintings might show the shepherds and the wise men worshipping together usually in the stable. You have camels, sheep, cattle, even dogs. You might have the star above the stable and angels all included. Jesus, Joseph and Mary look European usually, Jesus can sometimes be blond, or they might look like another culture, depending where the representation is from.I think all this adds to the feeling of celebration, and though I realize these things don\\u2019t strictly speaking go together, I think well why not? I\\u2019m not going to be pedantic about what really happened and when. Art is a representation after all.I think people can read each gospel independently and/or read and compare the two gospel birth stories and/or interpret Jesus\\u2019s birth through harmonized nativity scenes just as interests them. I wouldn\\u2019t tell anybody which of those ways to approach the Christmas story, and I wouldn\\u2019t like churches or individual Christians to start dictating to others how they should approach it either.'],\n",

Maybe I'm misinterpreting the word harmonize, but it seems like we are being quietly encouraged to start with the assumption that the accounts are contradictory and some work needs to be done to make them fit with each other. As far as I can see, we have 2 accounts that don't mention the birth at all, and 2 that do. In the 2 that do, I can't seem to find any blatantly contradictory details. It is simply 2 authors highlighting different portions of the story. The gospels clearly aren't meant to be exhaustive narratives and history books of every individual thing that happened- the authors clearly chose and arranged the narratives in order to build to a specific climax. One story recounts wise men, another shepherds. While it seems like the shepherds showed up right after Jesus' birth, we have no real time frame for when the wise men came, although it seems to have been before the circumcision. That gives a full 8 days between when the shepherds came and when the wise men could have come, so there is nothing here to reconcile.\"],\n",
       " 28: [u\"My favourite image of the nativity is Sandro Botticelli's 'The Mystical Nativity' - it is a strongly interpretive work designed to convey theological messages: The angels at the bottom are embracing humans, symbolising Christ bringing God's peace on earth, little demons are running away to the sides. The place of the birth is an inn / cave amalgam, signifying that various elements of the gospel accounts are being fused.

I think this allows and encourages Christians to identify more closely with Jesus as a model. \\nIt makes a difference whether people read the gospels independently, compare the stories or read a harmonized version because one really needs to understand that they were written from oral tradition by writers not eyewitnesses. The reader must learn that these are \"inspired words\" from God or stories of Jesus that have been written, rewritten, interpreted, re-interpreted & translated.'],\n",
       " 30: [u\"The blending of the differing birth narratives gives the shepherds (from the gospel of Luke) and the wise men (from Matthew).  Growing up in the Christian tradition, I was exposed to nativity scenes early in life and only as an adult did I learn that the stories had been merged together.  I also learned that the Bible doesn't tell us how many wise men were present--the usual number of three that is represented comes from the three gifts that are mentioned.\"],\n",
       " 31: [u'Firstly, I do not support the wholesale transmission of Christianity by paintings and drawings, for the simple reason that such mediums are limited in what they can convey.  Added to this is the intentional biases that a majority of Italians painters embarked upon, heavily influenced by the Diocese.  For example, Leonardo de Vinci portrays John as a young man, with feminine features, sitting next to Jesus at the last Supper.  Scriptural narratives are totally silent of such a theme.  Generally, the feminine features that many Italian painters portrayed in their works of Biblical characters has tainted our thinking on gender.  So I will limit my contribution to this discussion to a preference for reading the narratives in the Bible over the impressions created by painters.'],\n",

       " 34: [u'I think the representations of Jesus\\' nativity are understood in different ways, depending on how each Christian understands Jesus, just as how each Christian reads and understands the gospels (and decides which are given preference or read in light of which others, etc) has the potential to leave each reader with a different understanding of who Jesus was and what his message entailed. I think this is evident when we look at all the different denominations within Christianity and the different claims within the religion regarding who Jesus was and what he taught. Was he  God incarnate, literal \"Son of God,\" who paid for our admission to the preferable afterlife? Or was he a man focused on challenging the Roman Empire\\'s domination system and advocating for a society built upon the prophets\\' call to social justice? Do we read the Old Testament through the lens of what we think the New Testament is saying about Jesus, or do we read the New Testament and come to understand Jesus through the lens of the Old Testament and Jewish interpretation?  Different types of Christians will give you different answers. How they read and relate to the passages within the Bible will help determine what kind of answer they give.',\n",

       " 36: [u\"Most nativity pictures include a variety of images from the gospels according to the painter.  And I think they are perceived by the viewers based on the nativity story that most resonates with that person.  I have heard Luke's version of the nativity many more times than Matthew's, so I always see the manger, the wise me, the angels, and the faithful animals.  I sometimes see soldiers (Herod's I assume), but rarely do I see a cave or even look for one.  \",\n",

In regard to the characters involved, they rise fundamental theological errors:Despite this discrepancies, the scene still give strong message to world about birth of Jesus and why He came. Human sin required a perfect sacrifice before a holy and just God. He sent His own son to earth as a man so that He could become a sacrifice (John 3:16). The child who was born to Mary and laid in a manger would grow up to die on a cross and rise again so each and every person who believes in Him may receive forgiveness for sin and eternity in heaven (1Peter 1:3-4)',\n",
       "  u'I have read your comments.'],\n",
       " 38: [u\"I find that a major part of the importance of Jesus's birth in the nativity scene is his humble beginnings (born in a barn, man).  He was born in a manger, or a cave or something, but regardless, he was born in a very humble way.  This is obviously pervasive throughout the rest of his teachings and the way he lived his life, as we read stories about him being barefoot, constantly helping others, etc.  I think the exact location of his birth is less important than the implied wonders that come with his birth.  The gospels work together to build a story of Jesus, and I think trying to separate them is kind of impossible.  The interpretation of the birth of Christ through all four gospels gives us a fuller grasp of the story.  We respect and love the humbleness, I think.\"],\n",
       " 39: [u'The nativity scenes have a certain type of mysticism to them. Jesus is not actually the focal point in many of the scenes, in fact his tiny body is not even noticed in some scenes. However, once you take a good look at it you begin to see so much love around him. In each of the pictures his Mother is showing so much love and he seems to fill her with love. I think the Gospels help interpret the meaning of the Nativity scenes. I also believe they should be read independently. Much of the Bible repeats the same stories but from different perspectives. So, I believe it is very important to read each gospel to understand the complete story of Jesus.  The artwork as well as the gospel helps Christians visualize the significance of this high spiritual being. '],\n",

       " 42: [u\"Based on the nativity scenes I've seen Jesus was born in a manger on a pile of hay. He was surrounded by some animals but very soon after three wisemen came (my nativity scene Jesus was not being searched for to be killed). There was a star above him. Normally in the story I hear Joseph is the one that finds out after Mary is pregnant that it was the Holy Spirit that did it.\"],\n",
       " 43: [u\"The Nativity does not play a role in the earliest accounts of Jesus' life, and it may have been an event whose importance was only recognized at a later date in the history of the Jesus Movement that became Christianity. The sublime nature of the His life and resurrection could lead, and still does lead, people to believe that he was a purely spiritual being without a material life at all. If the gospel account is only to be taken as a rendering of an event that occurred in heaven alone (e.g. Earl Doherty), then it would not require any change in the material circumstances of humanity.The two narratives of his birth both intend to place Jesus in his rightful place on earth. For Matthew and Luke these may be differing views on earthly life itself, and not primarily different stories of the origin of the Christ. The attempt to harmonize is ineffective because the gospels are intended from the outset to be separate and complete.\"],\n",
       " 44: [u\"I think they communicate different aspects of Jesus' life, mission and history, and that it's important to read all of them together. When I was growing up in a Christian church, we'd learn a few verses from this or that book, or the sermon would focus on a few verses from a different book. There was no continuity, no sense of wholeness. Not until my early 20s did I read the entire Bible, cover to cover. The difference was striking in reading all four gospels together. Given that the four writers (with the possible exception of John, IIRC, although I believe Mark is considered to be the oldest gospel) didn't know Jesus, I imagine there is a lot of reliance on oral tradition or at best speaking to people who knew or whose parents or grandparents knew him. If people read only one gospel, I think they'd have a lopsided view of Jesus as well as Christians' beliefs. With all four, you get a more well-rounded picture.\"],\n",
       " 45: [u\"If we consider these representations as interpretations of the gospel narratives, what do you think they communicate about Jesus? About the beliefs of Christians? I think they communicate the generally accepted narrative of the birth of Jesus which Christians believe - that he was born of Mary, in a manger due to there being no room at the inn, that he was vistited by wise men and shepherds, that the animals were gathered all round - a harmonized story gleaned from those Gospels that tell of the story of Jesus' birth, which is a fundamental tenet of Christian belief.What difference do you think it makes whether people read each gospel independently, read and compare all the gospel birth stories, or interpret Jesus\\u2019s birth through harmonized nativity scenes? I think reading all of the Gospels and getting an understanding of the similar but different stories gives adds to your internal harmony, if you will - your own internal dialogue of how things went.\"],\n",
       " 46: [u'I do not practice a formalized Christian religion so I do not have a comparison to draw from. I would suspect that over time, as each (catholic, protestant, etc.) were developed, they gravitated towards a specific gospel and it is that specific gospel that informed their vision of a nativity scene. However, religious artists who wanted to appeal to a wide range of Christians, or scholars perhaps, might create a harmonized work of art.',\n",
       "  u\"That's a very good perspective.  I think most Christians do have a favorite gospel birth story that they relate to.  And most nativity scenes seem to be a combination of 2 or all 3 synoptic gospels.\"],\n",
       " 47: [u\"Honestly, I never know that there are different narratives about the birth of Jesus before, but knew that he was born in the barn house with wise men from East visiting. I think the representation can make many different stories. There is also this argument about the racial issue around Jesus, that most of paintings represented Jesus depicts him White, when Jesus isn't actually. This can bring very different notion to the people who see those paintings and interpret the related stories in the bible. \"],\n",
       " 48: [u'We must realise that all the reprezentation of the native birth of Jesus drives from tow sources, one is the bible and another is from traditional understanding. If we refer to Bible we found three stories about this native. the story acording Matew, Mark and Luck. So every story gives us a picture about the native. I think that the Tintoreto native scene include the all stories. In my opinion the authorship of the gospel do not reprezint throw narative story a picture for a painter. Because of this every reprezentation is a master pice of a talented man instad a fidel reprezentation of the native story. Because of this some old reprezentative pictures created by prolific artists or artistic reprezentation in many forms shiped our imaginaitons about the Jesus birth in such a way that if some one ask to draw that we reproduce the pictures of what we have seen after. Olso every text which do not have a picture drow by the author provide us liberty to imagine a lot of things about that text which can be different from other to other. When we think about the massage, or the principle which drives form a text, we must be faitfully to the original intention of the author.

       "  u'Whoops!  Hit \"submit\" too soon.  I think that what nativity scenes communicate about Jesus is that his origins are important to accepting him as the Messiah.  They take great pains to attach an otherworldliness to the story of his birth, even moreso than his teachings.  To me, it says that his good works were not enough - that only as a divine being is belief in him justified.  I think both approaches to reading the Gospels are interesting, and one should embark on both of them at some time in one\\'s study.  The coherence in reading them separately is a fuller understanding of a particular way of understanding Jesus in a particular context. Each Gospel is complete, and in reading them in their entirety, one gains a better understanding of him than if one only reads the various sections comparatively.  But, reading the sections comparatively (i.e. the birth story, the parts about John the Baptist) may be useful if one is doing an analysis of truth in the scriptures themselves, or is trying to piece together the overarching complete story.  '],\n",

       " 51: [u\"art - particularly christian art of the renaissance - was designed to lift one's spirits.  To help people believe that there was a greater and better existence than that which they were experiencing.  The paintings of the nativity scene clearly needed to be surreal and otherworldly - they were depicting the birth of Jesus.  Matthew and Luke refer to baby Jesus being put in a manger because there was no room in the inn - this infers that he was not necessarily 'born' in the manger, rather nursed there.  But the imagery of the son of God being born among animals - being at one with nature and other creatures is too compelling for any artist.  The ability to contrast the light of the lord with the dark dankness of a manger would have been enticing to any artist - and so a version of the story was formed.\"],\n",

No doubt, that's a difference in personal characteristics. Each of the gospels tries to accomplish its particular goals. So does each depiction of the events of the birth -- each nativity scene has its own particular perspective, drawing more or less on whichever gospel story/ies speak most to that artist. Clearly, they all say a lot more about Christian beliefs than they do about Jesus. It's as if Jesus were a magic mirror that shifts widely depending on perspective. I don't really think it matters whether an artist or writer draws primarily on one story or on an amalgam. What does matter is their own personal sifting and interpretation. It's all interpretation, isn't it? Even the gospels themselves. \"],\n",

       " 55: [u'Nativity scenes obviously tell us that Jesus came into our world as a human baby, but was immediately known as someone very special.  Most manger scenes combine gospel accounts.  The wise men arrived on the scene later, when Herod sent them to find Jesus, but they are always shown in the manger depictions as being there in the cave right away.  To get an accurate picture, I think we need to read the stories together.  The nativity scenes give a pictorial but not a narrative account of the birth and the actions happening at the time.',\n",
       "  u'Exactly.'],\n",
       " 56: [u'Even if one has read the book, a film or cartoon version is so much more memorable so maybe the art and performances of the nativity precede or overtake the canonical narratives and their differences (animals, magi). When I first was introduced to Eastern Orthodoxy, I was surprised at both the content (Jesus born in a cave) and the form (Mary bigger than others to show her importance).  '],\n",
       " 57: [u'The nativity paintings shown in the text were created at a time when most people were illiterate and so they became the \"message\" of the bible.  Most of the painters of course never saw a barn or a manger from the first century so they used their imagination.  The same is true of the baby Jesus, if a Spaniard was painting the baby looked Spanish, or if it were a German the baby was Germanic!  The same applies to Mary and Joseph.  The family was one of US!'],\n",
       " 58: [u'Most artistic and dramatic representations of the birth narrative generally combine elements of the the gospels of both Matthew and Luke. Artistic interpretations across the centuries have elements of the cultural context of the artist regarding appearances of inns and stables and disregarding the historical accuracy of depiction of both. These interpretations also gave rise to legends regarding the animals present and the characters of wise men and shepherds. We have bought into it and lovingly maintain these historical distortions.'],\n",
       " 59: [u'The nativity scenes are beautiful and symbolic of a great occasion in the life of Christ ,the church and the world. The depictions of the birth of Christ in paintings is the same . They reflect the 3gospel stories in various ways....all seem so beautiful. We all enjoy them'],\n",
       " 60: [u\"These illustrations communicate what the artists believes to be important about Jesus\\u2019s birth story. These works are not only a product of the artist's interpretation, but naturally also forces the observer to interpret the artist\\u2019s interpretation, which makes it highly subjective. However, there\\u2019s no wrong in observing these as long as we realize its subjectivity.Reading the gospels independently could resolve some issues but it will completely disregard the possibility that the divinely inspired different works actually somehow work in conjunction to explain a particular subject.\"],\n",
       " 61: [u'Nativity Representations ~  What do they communicate about Jesus?  St. Francis introduced the first living nativity scene to make the gospel story come alive for his followers/parishioners.  That\\'s perhaps the overarching message of all representations of the scene.  And just as there are different messages given by the style of a written Bible text, so too there is a slightly different message given by the style of a nativity scene.  A living nativity bring the story to life - literally.  An arrangements of statues in a church yard does the same thing but is perhaps slightly more detached and perhaps more mysterious.  Something under your own Christmas tree brings it into your home.  So these representations communicate that Jesus can be found at all of these different levels.~  What do they say about the beliefs of Christians?  The diversity of the representations simply reflects the diversity of the history and the sociology of Christianity.  ~  What difference does it make if you read them independently, compare them or harmonize them?  Well, personally I think they should be read in a harmonized way at first.  It equalizes the perspectives and might tend to mitigate conflicts between versions.  Then each book should be read separately to begin to look at each element of the harmonized whole - and I think each element should be presented that way.  Then finally the versions should be compared.  Once you are confident in the details of each story you are better able to reflect on the comparisons - similarities and differences.  The thing, I think, that is not taught well enough if that there is validity in each different perspective.  The differences are the result of history, perspective and audience.  These facts should be taught.  One can then choose which perspective fits one own\\'s beliefs and priorities and, frankly, calling or \"inner voice.\"  I believe the Holy Spirit leads ones reading of the scriptures and one may be an academic, a historian, a religious, clergy or lay.  One may be Orthodox or Charismatic or any other stripe of Christian and you will find your place in the scriptures if you allow the Holy Spirit to guide you. '],\n",
       " 62: [u'I think   The nativity scenes which is very well known in all the Christians countries It main purpose is to remain us that Jesus was born in an humble conditions surrounded by the most meek of them all: the mule and ox, sheep, doves, shepherds. The three magic kings bringing presents to the would be king of the Jews are represented in the scene as well.\\nThe scene is drawn from the description given by the Gospel\\xb4s writers besides the imagination of the artist who created each scene.'],\n",
       " 63: [u\"In most cases that I saw, the nativity scene had Jesus with a nimbus above his head, which immediately told about his divine nature. These scenes are full of tenderness, simplicity and modesty - all three definitely are key features of Christianity. \\nI think that choosing the way to approach the nativity scene will strongly depend upon person's character as well as his actual aim. In case one likes to analyse the sciptures he would be reading and comparing the gospels texts, while in case a person is approaching it emotionally he would rather go for harmonized nativity scenes.   \"],\n",
       " 64: [u'Nativity scene represents the birth story of Jesus according the Matthew\\xb4s gospel. Crib is in the stable, Jesus is surronded by his parents, cattle and 3 kings, who bring him presents. Under the stable is comet.This nativity scene presents Jesus like son of god, man who is different and precious from the moment of his birth, despite he is poor. Powerful, rich kings give a homige to poor, just born baby. In the Cristianity is always emphasized the unimportance of wealth.Every gospel tells diferent part of story of Jesus birth, so reading just one gospel doesn\\xb4t give an entire picture about the story.'],\n",
       " 65: [u'I believe that the mainstream Nativity scene and imagery communicates to Christians and non-Christians alike that Jesus\\'s birth was holy, and that his coming was to bring hope and salvation. Additionally, mirroring some of the comments above from my fellow students, those who are more familiar with the socioeconomic milieu of that era, would also point out that Jesus\\'s birth, while immaculate and divine, took place in a humble, \"working-class\" setting - his salvation is to be available to all.With that being said, I definitely still feel it is important for people to examine and ponder the Gospels independently. In particular, mainstream representation of the Nativity seems to largely highlight Matthew and Luke. John 1 might be more difficult to \"harmonize\", but it is still fundamentally essential, as well as the role that John the Baptist takes.'],\n",
       " 66: [u'These representations make us feel that Jesus was born pure, unlike normal birth, which involves intimacy between a man and woman. He was a Holy and Divine soul and believed to be truly the Son of God. Christians believe that such a conception is totally divine and may not arise a question if the Birth of Jesus was truly the son of God or not. They may not challenge the Divine work of God.\\nIf people would read the gospel independently, they would get the message the writer of the Gospel is trying to convey. If the reader reads and compare they will see the differences present in the gospel and decipher from their reading the perspective the writer has on the same event. How much is known from the different writers about only 1 event. Interpreting through harmonised nativity scene will enable the reader to link all the stories and see them as 1. '],\n",
       " 67: [u'I think that the manger, even that it is not mention, it symbolizes an important part of Christianity doctrine, of how Christ was born humble and modest. It is valid to make the interpretation that Jesus was born in several places. However, raised Catholic, I was amazed of how an interpretation could be transformed into a tradition and then to be  acknowledged as the oficial representation for millions of people.          '],\n",
       " 68: [u'I think this is an illustration of how truth has many definitions. Different people see through different filters, and, thus, I would expect each might establish a different perception of the events described in the different texts.  I guess one way to put this is to say instead of a focal point, truth may be a fuzzy point.  I would bet that if someone were to read and study only of the narratives they would know enough of this story to achieve the purposes of all these writings.  If they came to this same understanding through a painting or a song or a poem or some other mode of communication, the same objective might be achieved. .'],\n",
       " 69: [u'The nativity scenes are the harmonization of the Gospel accounts. It would be nice to do an exhibition with four cribs refresentaran each different accounts of the birth.\\nRegarding the different traditions we must know that every gospel was destined for a different community.'],\n",
       " 70: [u'The Gospels were writen about a hundred years before the birth of Jesus. I believe wich one have a different perspective of the fact. Maybe the better way to know the birth is a mix of the Gospels. And the artistic representations are a mox of Marc, Luke and Matthew Gospels.'],\n",
       " 71: [u'I think they at least try to communicate that the nativity scene was a historical event, with important spiritual significance. Whilst it is not wrong to try to harmonise the four gospels, I still think people should read them independently, to allow the original authors to communicate in the way intended, so that their message of who Jesus is, is properly conveyed.'],\n",
       " 72: [u\"An earlier thread pointed out some discrepancies between scriptures and the\\npainting's depiction. The following link details the discrepancies.http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/christmas-nativity-scene-flaws/419634/ .\\nWe view in one scene baby Jesus and his family in humble settings whether in a manger or someone's home in Bethlehem.\"],\n",
       " 73: [u'the scene of Jesus nativity  purpose is to demostrate, Jesus as human, so the peope can not confuse him with an angel or other prophet from the Old testament and give a fundation about Jesus genealogy '],\n",
       " 74: [u'I will start a description with the background of the picture. On the right side, we see the shepherds and an angel, who is appearing to them. On the left side, we see, maybe, the King Herod with his soldiers in searching for baby Jesus to kill and to destroy him. In the front side, we see the baby Jesus laying in a manger, because there is no place for them in the inn (as it is written in the Gospel of Luke). Besides, there are also some animals, such as sheep, dog, rabbit, etc.'],\n",
       " 75: [u'Different environments and cultures will create there own differences too, clothing the presence of men or women will all differ and subtlety shade the way they are perceived.  For example (an crudely)  the wise men might make Jesus seem like one of the elite but shepherd make him see like one of the poor.  ']}"
